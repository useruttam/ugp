        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE R. BASANT1. The petitioner is the accused in a prosecution under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Proceedings were initiated as early as in 2001. Once the petitioner was found guilty, convicted and sentenced, in the appeal, the learned Sessions Judge had sent the matter back to the learned Magistrate for giving opportunity to the petitioner to adduce defence evidence.2. When the matter came up before the learned Magistrate again, the petitioner filed the defence witness list of 3 witnesses. They are the mother, the brother and the sister respectively of the defacto complainant. The petitioner wanted those witnesses to be examined. What is the purpose ? Entering into an agreement and issue of cheque on the basis of the said agreement is not disputed. The short contention raised is that there has been discharge of the liability. Payments made subsequent to the lodging of the proceedings are evidenced by receipts and those receipts have been produced. There is no dispute regarding receipt of amounts under those receipts by the complainant. According to the petitioner, he wants to examine these 3 witnesses, close relatives of the complainant to raise and support contention that payments prior to the date of the agreement and the date of the cheque are liable to be given due credit.3. The learned Magistrate appears to have obligingly issued summons to those witnesses obviously because of the direction in the judgment of the appellate court. The presence of those witnesses could not be ensured. At that stage, the petitioner filed an application calling upon the complainant to furnish the address of those witnesses. The learned Magistrate had dismissed the said petition holding that there is no provisions in the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973.4. It is contended that the approach of the learned Magistrate is incorrect. Powers under Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is sufficient in its scope to issue such a direction in the interests of justice.5. I must alertly remind myself of the nature, quality and contours of the jurisdiction which I am called upon to invoke and exercise. The extraordinary inherent jurisdiction is sought to be invoked. Every error in facts or in law committed by subordinate courts will not ip so facto persuade this Court to invoke the inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Is there failure of justice, is the crucial question to be considered. So reckoned, I do not find any failure of justice resulting from the impugned order. Even the attempt to insist on the examination of the witnesses does appear to me to be only a ploy to drag on the proceedings. It is crucial to note that subsequent to the date of the agreement and date of the cheque, there is no disputed payments at all. The attempt is to advance a contention that the anterior payments made must also be creditted towards the subsequent agreement and cheque issued. I shall not encumber records with any unnecessary finding on merits. Suffice it to say that I am satisfied that this is not a fit case where the jurisdiction under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 can or ought to be invoked even assuming the order of the learned Magistrate could have been different in view of the sweeping mandate under Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.6. This Crl.M.C is, in these circumstances, dismissed. There shall be a direction to the learned Magistrate to dispose of the case as expeditiously as possible now.Order accordingly"

In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C. No.2153/2001 on the file of the J.F.C.M.-II, Kollam challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against her for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the appellant in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner.5. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the appellant provided she complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.88, 400/- (Rupees eighty eight thousand and four hundred only) within three months from today, then she need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, the revision petitioner shall undergo default sentence by way of simple imprisonment for three months. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

Cognizance has been taken. Consequent to the non-appearance of the petitioner, coercive processes have been issued against the petitioner. Steps are being taken by the court to secure the presence of the petitioner.2. The petitioner, through his counsel, submits that the petitioner is absolutely innocent. According to the petitioner he had no clue of the pendency of the proceedings before the learned Magistrate. The petitioner is willing to appear before the learned Magistrate through counsel and co-operate for the early disposal of the case. To show his bonafides he is willing to deposit the entire cheque amount and some amount to provide for the interest and cost. This offer is made to show the bonafides of the petitioner. He may be permitted to appear through counsel. The mere fact that warrant of arrest has been issued may not stand in the way of the learned Magistrate considering and accepting the request of the petitioner for exemption from personal appearance, submits the counsel. I find the request to be absolutely justified.3. This Crl.M.C. is allowed. It is directed that if the petitioner deposits an amount of Rs.11, 000/- before the learned Magistrate and applies through counsel to exempt him from personal appearance and to permit him to appear through counsel, the learned Magistrate shall accept the said request and exempt the petitioner from personal appearance. The fact that a warrant of arrest and coercive processes have been issued against the petitioner shall not stand in the way of the learned Magistrate considering and accepting the said request for exemption. It is now trite that the plea of the accused can be recorded and the proceedings can be continued even without his personal appearance, when he is exempted from appearance. The learned Magistrate shall proceed with the case. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that if the complainant is prepared to withdraw the case, the petitioner has no objection against the release of the entire amount of Rs.11, 000/- to the complainant. That offer and submission is also specifically taken note of and recorded so that the court below can act on the same.Order accordingly"

In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C. No.272/2001 on the file of the J.F.C.M.-II, Aluva challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 2nd respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.75, 000/- (Rupees seventy five thousand only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4.

Cognizance was taken. The petitioner had allegedly appeared before the learned Magistrate. She was enlarged on bail. From and after 09/02/2007, the petitioner was not able to appear before the learned Magistrate. Consequently, the learned Magistrate has issued coercive processes against the petitioner. The petitioner finds a warrant of arrest issued by the learned Magistrate chasing her.2. According to the petitioner, she is absolutely innocent. Her non-appearance was not wilful. The petitioner is willing to surrender before the learned Magistrate and apply for bail. She shall co-operate for the expeditious disposal of the case. But she apprehends that her application for bail may not be considered by the learned Magistrate on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. She, therefore, prays that directions under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 may be issued to the learned Magistrate to release the petitioner on bail when she appears and applies for bail.3. It is for the petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate and explain to the learned Magistrate, the circumstances under which she could not earlier appear before the learned Magistrate.4. I find absolutely no reason to assume that the learned Magistrate would not consider the application for bail to be filed by the petitioner on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. Every court must do the same. No special or specific directions appear to be necessary. Sufficient general directions have been issued in Alice George vs. Deputy Superintendent of Police [2003(1)KLT 339]2003 (1) KLT 339.5. In the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is dismissed but with the specific observation that if the petitioner surrenders before the learned Magistrate and applies for bail, after giving sufficient prior notice to the Prosecutor in charge of the case, the learned Magistrate must proceed to pass appropriate orders on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously - on the date of surrender itself.Order accordingly"

The matter was taken up in suo moto revision over the order of the appellate court in C.C.No.258/93 with respect to the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.2. The complainants case is that the accused had borrowed a sum of Rs.9, 000/- and towards the discharge of the above liability the impugned cheque was issued which when presented got dishonoured for want of funds in the account of the accused. No reply was received to the lawyer notice sent nor was any amount paid. The trial court convicted and sentenced him to undergo simple imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of Rs.15, 000/- and in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for three months and out of the fine amount, if realised, Rs.11, 500/- is ordered to be given to PW1 vide Section 357 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. But the appellate court upheld the conviction and set aside the sentence imposed as the Magistrate is not having the power to impose a fine of Rs.15, 000/-. I find that the lower appellate court was erred in setting aside the sentence imposed by the trial court without remitting the matter back to the trial court for imposing the appropriate sentence. The matter is of the year 1993.3. In the circumstances, the conviction is confirmed and the sentence is modified to imprisonment till the rising of the court and to pay a compensation of Rs.12, 000/- to PW1 and in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for one month. The accused shall appear before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Sulthan Batheri on 8.10.2007 to receive the sentence.The criminal revision petition is disposed of as above.Petition disposed of"

It is for the petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate and explain to the learned Magistrate the circumstances under which he could not earlier appear before the learned Magistrate. I have no reason to assume that the learned Magistrate would not consider the petitioner's application for regular bail on merits in accordance with law and expeditiously. No special or specific directions appear to be necessary. Every court must do the same.

The case was filed as early as in 2004. The case has now reached the stage of final arguments. The petitioner has come before this Court with the grievance that he has been denied the opportunity to adduce defence evidence. He submits that he wants to examine himself under Section 315 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. He wants to examine one more person as witness on his side. When he had the opportunity of adducing defence evidence, the petitioner did not adduce evidence. Subsequently an application was filed before the learned Magistrate to permit the petitioner to examine himself and his witnesses. The learned Magistrate by the impugned order rejected the said prayer.2. In the course of arguments before me, the learned counsel for the petitioner only prays that the petitioner may be given one more opportunity to examine the petitioner as also one witness by name Viji before the learned Magistrate.3. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that there shall be not even a days delay to examine those witnesses. The petitioner shall be present on the next date of posting along with the said witness and shall get ready to examine both of them on that day. Indulgent opportunity to examine the petitioner and the said witness may be granted, submits the learned counsel for the petitioner.4. I do not find any gross irregularity or error in the impugned order. However, I am satisfied that in the interests of justice, the petitioner can be given one opportunity to examine himself and the said witness Viji as defence witnesses on his side. Appropriate condition can of course be imposed. In the nature of the relief that I propose to grant, I am satisfied that it is not necessary to wait for issue and return of notice to the respondent-complainant. This petition is, in these circumstances, allowed.5. On the next date of posting, on condition that the petitioner pays an amount of Rs.250/- as cost to the complainant, the learned Magistrate shall permit the petitioner to examine himself and one witness Viji as defence witnesses. Such witnesses must be present/produced before the learned Magistrate on the next date of posting.6. Hand over a copy of this order to the learned counsel for the petitioner today itself. Notice of this order shall be given by the learned counsel for the petitioner to the learned counsel for the complainant also.Order accordingly"

The petitioner submits that his absence before court was not wilful or deliberate; but was due to reasons beyond the control of the petitioner. The petitioner is now willing to appear before the learned Magistrate to receive the sentence. But he apprehends that he may be remanded to custody unnecessarily and his application for bail may not be considered by the learned Magistrate on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously.2. The case now stands posted for orders as revealed from the submissions of the petitioner. The petitioner can certainly appear before the learned Magistrate and the learned Magistrate must proceed to pass orders on such date of surrender itself, if the judgment is ready. If the judgment is not ready, the learned Magistrate must consider the application for bail to be filed by the petitioner on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. The warrant of arrest issued against the petitioner shall not be executed till 23/7/2007. On or before that date, the petitioner must appear before the learned Magistrate and seek further directions.Hand over copy of this order to the learned counsel for the petitioner.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE V. RAMKUMAR1. In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C. No.120/1994 on the file of the J.F.C.M.-III, Neyyattinkara challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. The learned counsel appearing for the revision petitioner contended that the cheque in question was actually entrusted with one Christudas by the revision petitioner who had arranged visa to the said Christudas for going abroad and at that time the revision petitioner had entrusted a blank signed cheque with Christudas, who was really misusing the same by handing over the same to the complainant, who is none other than his brother-in-law. The revision petitioner, admittedly, had received the statutory notice issued by the complainant. If his case be that the cheque in question was entrusted with Christudas, when he received statutory notice in this case, he must have realized that Christudas, with whom he had entrusted the cheque, had deceived and had misused the same by handing over the cheque to the complainant. Admittedly, he has not called upon Christudas to return the cheque nor has he sent even a notice to Christudas informing the latter that he had misused the cheque entrusted with him by the revision petitioner. This conduct of the revision petitioner also speaks volumes to indicate that his defence cannot be accepted without a pinch of salt. It was in the backdrop of this that the trial court, which had the unique advantage of seeing the witness and assessing their credibility, was inclined to accept the testimony of the complainant. The lower appellate court has also confirmed the conviction. So long as this court is not able to find any infirmity in the appreciation of evidence by the courts below, this court, sitting in the rarefied revisional jurisdiction, will be loathe to dislodge the said finding recorded by the courts below concurrently. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding of guilt. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. a sum of Rs.90, 000/- (Rupees ninety thousand only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.50, 000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only) within three months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE R. BASANT1. The petitioner faces indictment in a prosecution under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The petitioner has come to this Court with a plea that cognizance should not have been taken and the cognizance taken deserves to be quashed by invoking the powers under Section 482 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973.2. What is the ground ? The cheque is dated 6.10.05 admittedly. The cheque was presented for collection through the collecting bank of the complainant. The collecting bank allegedly sent the cheque to the drawee bank. The drawee bank by dishonour memo dated 17.04.06 dishonoured the cheque and returned the same on the ground that there was insufficiency of funds. The complainant after observing the statutory formalities filed a complaint before the learned Magistrate and the learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offence alleged under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.3. The learned counsel for the petitioner contends that proviso (a) to Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 has not at all been observed and consequently the cognizance taken is bad. The proviso (a) to Section 138 reads as follows:\"Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply unless -(a) the cehque has been presented to the bank within a period of six months from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier.4. It is imperative that the cheque must have been presented to the bank within a period of 6 months from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier. Whatever be the period of validity of the cheque in the instant case, the cheque must be presented within a period of 6 months from the date on which it is drawn. The cheque admittedly is dated 6.10.05. The cheque must therefore have been presented by 6.4.06.5. To whom must the cheque be presented ? Is it enough if the cheque presented before the collecting bank for collection or is the cheque to be presented before the drawee bank by that date ? The question does not admit on any doubt now in the light of the decision in Shri Ishar Alloy Steels Ltd. v. Jayaswals Neco Ltd. [2001(3) SCC 609]2001 (3) SCC 6092001 ILO SC 20267. It is very evident now that the presentation contemplated in proviso (a) is not presentation to any other bank for collection but presentation before the drawee bank for honouring the cheque. There can be no surviving doubt on that question of law after the decision in Shri Ishar Alloy Steels Ltd. v. Jayaswals Neco Ltd. (supra).6. It is now evident that the cheque has been presented well after elapse of the period of 6 months from the date on which it is drawn. The learned counsel for the complainant contends that the complainant had presented the cheque well before the date of expiry of 6 months before his bank ie. on 16.3.06 and that he is not responsible for any dealy in the drawee bank getting the cheque and issuing the memo of dishonour. The complaint has been produced as Annexure-A1. Significantly there is no averment whatsover that the cheque was presented before the drawee bank before the expiry of the period of 6 months as contemplated in proviso (a).7. I do in these circumstances find that the complaint is not maintainable and the same deserves to be quashed.8. In the result, this Crl.M.C is, allowed. S.T.No.1376 of 2006 before the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-II, Peerumedu is hereby quashed.Order accordingly"

He challenges the judgment of the trial court in the above case by which the respondent/1st accused was acquitted by the court below of the charge of an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The allegation in the complaint filed against the 1st respondent/accused was that he had borrowed an amount of Rs.2, 50, 000/= from the appellant/complainant on 14.4.1996 and for the discharge of the said amount, a cheque was issued and when the cheque was presented for encashment, the same was dishonoured on the ground of insufficiency of fund with the account of the 1st respondent/accused. On complying the provisions regarding notice and on seeing that the amount has not been repaid, the complaint has been filed before the court. Before the trial court, the appellant/complainant himself was examined as PW1 and produced Exts.P1 to P6. The 1st respondent/accused was questioned on closing the evidence adduced on behalf of the appellant under Section 313 of the Code. The 1st respondent denied the allegations in the complaint. He had stated further that he had only borrowed the amount of Rs.25, 000/= from the appellant and at the time of receiving that amount, he had given a blank cheque as security for the said amount. According to the 1st respondent/accused, the said amount was also repaid but the cheque was not returned and by misusing that cheque, the complaint has been filed. To prove the case of the 1st respondent, he himself was examined as DW1 and another witness - DW2 was also examined. Ext.D1 receipt for an amount of Rs.35, 000/= was also produced. Hence, the trial court found that the appellant had not proved that the cheque in question was issued for the discharge of the alleged amount of Rs.2, 50, 000/= and hence, the appeal was filed before this Court2. After hearing the learned counsel on either side and on perusing the records made available to this Court, I am of the view that the trial court had considered the entire evidence adduced before the court and came to the conclusion that the appellant could not prove the case against the 1st respondent and hence the acquittal has been ordered. The trail court found that the appellant had never in his possession Rs.2, 50, 000/= or above and he was not in a position to give such a huge amount as loan to the 1st respondent. Further the trial court found that the case set up by the appellant that he had borrowed an amount of Rs. Four Lakhs and Odd from a Co-operative Bank was also not established by any documentary evidence or any other evidence. Further the trial court found that the case set up by the 1st respondent was correct and more probable and the trial court found as per Ext.D1 an amount of Rs.35, 000/= has been also paid to the appellant and this fact has been admitted by the appellant when he was cross examined. In the above circumstances, the acquittal is on evidence and there is no reason to interfere with the judgment of the trial court.Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed confirming the judgment of the trial court.Appeal dismissed"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 2nd respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.65, 000/- (Rupees sixty five thousand only) within three months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 2nd respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. a sum of Rs.2, 50, 000/- (Rupees two lakhs and fifty thousand only) within three months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court.

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE K. THANKAPPAN1. The appellant is the complainant in C.C.No. 2/93 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-I, Thamarassery. The appellant filed the complaint before the trial court alleging that the 1st respondent committed an offence punishable under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 on the allegation that the 1st respondent borrowed an amount of Rs.30, 000/- from the appellant and when the appellant demanded repayment of the amount, the 1st respondent issued Ext.P1 cheque to the appellant and when the cheque was presented for encashment, the same was dishonoured on the ground of insufficiency of funds in the account of the 1st respondent. After considering the evidence the trial court found that the 1st respondent guilty under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and he was convicted there under and sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for six months and also to pay a fine of Rs.5, 000/- and in default to undergo simple imprisonment for two months. Against the above findings the 1st respondent filed Crl.A.74/1995 before the Sessions Court, Kozhikode Division. The appellate court set aside the conviction and sentence and acquitted the 1st respondent. Aggrieved by the above, the appellant has approached this Court.2. This Court heard learned counsel for the appellant, learned counsel for the 1strespondent and learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel for the appellant contends that the finding of the lower appellate court has erred in appreciating the evidence adduced on the side of the appellant. It is also contended that the lower appellate court ought to have considered the case of the appellant and the evidence adduced by the appellant. It is further contended that the finding of the lower appellate court that the case set up by the 1st respondent is more probable than the case of the appellant is not supported by any evidence.4. The specific case of the appellant is that the 1st respondent had borrowed an amount of Rs.30, 000/- and in discharge of the said debt Ext.P1 cheque was issued. The case set up by the 1st respondent is that the cheque in question was issued as a security for the transaction between the appellant and one Rajan who is none other than his friend.5. PW1 is the complainant who had given evidence in tune with his complaint. PW2 had supported the evidence of PW1 and stated that PW1 gave Rs.30, 000/- to the 1st respondent and in return the 1st respondent gave a cheque to the appellant in his presence. PW3 stated that he saw the 1st respondent taking the amount from PW1. The trial court considered the above aspects and found that presumption under section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 was in favour of the appellant and the evidence of PWs.1 to 3 undoubtedly established that there was a legally enforceable debt due by the 1st respondent and towards the discharge of that debt the 1st respondent had issued Ext.P1 cheque in favour of PW1. The lower appellate court considered the evidence of PWs.1 to 3 and came to the conclusion that the appellant and the 1st respondent had great confidence in each other and hence the possibility of the 1st respondent handing over the cheque to the appellant in the circumstances pleaded by him could not be ruled out. PWs.1 and 2 had a definite case that the amount was obtained from PW2. It has come out in evidence that the amount was handed over to the appellant by PW2. Apart from the above, the lower appellate court has committed serious error in holding that \"PW2, a labourer kept Rs.30, 000/- with him from 1988 or 1989 till August 1991 when that amount is said to have been handed over to PW1\". Hence, the above finding is not based on any evidence.6. In the circumstances, this Court is of the view that the findings entered by the trial court are perverse and are liable to be set aside. Hence, the judgment under appeal is set aside and the matter is remitted to the trial court for fresh consideration. The parties are permitted to furnish additional evidence, if any, to substantiate their case.The parties shall appear before the trial court on 17-11-2007.The records shall be forwarded to the trial court forthwith.Order accordingly"

This is a petition to special leave to appeal filed by the complainant in S.T.No.644/06 on the file of the Court of the Special Judicial First Class Magistrate (Marad Cases), Kozhikode. In the complaint it is stated that the petitioner was a Private Limited Company engaged in chitty business and the 1st respondent in discharge of a liability of one Abdul Gafoor issued Ext.P3 cheque for an amount of Rs.33, 150/- in favour of the petitioner and when the cheque was presented for encashment, it was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds in the account of the 1st respondent. After complying the statutory formalities, the complaint has been filed alleging that the 1st respondent had committed an offence punishable under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. To prove the case against the 1st respondent, PW1 was examined and Exts.P1 to P8 were marked. After closing the prosecution evidence, the 1st respondent was questioned under section 313 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. He denied the allegations and stated that he was the subscriber of the chitty conducted by the petitioner and when he received the chitty amount two signed blank cheques were given to the petitioner and even after repayment of the entire amount of the chitty, demanding an exorbitant amount as interest, a false case was foisted against him mis-utilizing the blank cheque. After considering the entire evidence adduced by the petitioner and the 1st respondent, the trial court found that the petitioner company miserably failed to prove that impugned cheque was supported by consideration. At the same time, the trial court found that the case set up by the 1st respondent that blank cheque which handed over to the petitioner at the time of receiving the chitty amount was mis-utilized by the petitioner to stake a false complaint was more probable. After considering the entire evidence, this Court finds that the findings entered by the trial court are on evidence and the petitioner miserably failed to prove that the cheque in question was issued in discharge of a legally enforceable debt.2. In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the impugned judgment requires no interference by this Court. Hence, leave to appeal is rejected.Appeal dismissed"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner reiterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner.Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the first respondent complainant by way of compensation under Sec. 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs. 1, 10, 000/- (Rupees One Lakh Ten Thousand only) within five months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as a fore said, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence.5. Amount, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE V. RAMKUMAR1. In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in S.T. No.3041/2004 on the file of the J.F.C.M.-I, Sulthan Bathery challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice.4. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner submitted that the cheque in question for Rs.1, 50, 000/- is dated 16.2.04 which is 10 years after Ext.D2 publication by the revision petitioner in the 'Mathrubhumi' daily dated 17.2.94 to the effect that he had lost two signed blank papers and two signed blank cheques kept in his bag and that as on the date of the cheque the bank account stood closed. Both the courts have found that Ext.D2 publication in the 'Mathrubhumi' daily was a clever device conceived by the revision petitioner who is an abkari contractor, to wriggle out of his liability for the cheque to be issued thereafter.On the evidence before court it cannot be said that the above conclusion reached by the courts below is unsustainable or improbable. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.5. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.1, 50, 000/- (Rupees one lakh and fifty thousand only) within five months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.45, 000/- (Rupees forty five thousand only) within three months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. If the revision petitioner has deposited sum of Rs.22, 500/- (Rupees twenty two thousand five hundred only) pursuant to the orders passed by this court, the 1st respondent complainant shall be entitled to withdraw the said amount in which case the petitioner need only pay the balance amount of Rs.22, 500/- (Rupees twenty two thousand five hundred only) by way of compensation as ordered above.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE K. R. UDAYABHANU1. The appellant is the complainant in ST.94/1997 with respect to the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The complaint is with respect to dishonour of the impugned cheque for Rs.1, 23, 000/- issued to the financier with respect to the hire purchase of a lorry . The cheque when presented for collection got dishonoured on the ground of insufficiency of funds.2. The evidence adduced in the matter consisted the testimony of PWs1 and 2 and Exts. P1 to P7. The defence examined DWs1 and 2 and got marked Exts. D1 and D2.3. According to the complainant the amounts are due from the accused towards arrears of hire amount with respect to the purchase of the lorry No.KA.12/3359. The court below held that the case of the complainant cannot be upheld in view of the fact that the amount noted in the cheque ie., Rs.1, 23, 000/- is excessive as the instalments dues till date could be only Rs.1, 13, 064/-. The counsel for the appellant states that the amount calculated by the court is incorrect as Rs.46, 736/- i.e, the initial payment to the dealer of the vehicle is not the amount paid to the financier. It is pointed out that the amount has been included towards the amount paid by the hirer. It is also pointed out that the interest due has not been calculated by the court below.4. The other ground on which the complaint was dismissed is that notice was not served. It is pointed out that A.D card contained acknowledgment. It is, further pointed out by the complainant that subsequent to the filing of complaint summons was issued on the same address, and further as per the decision of the three member judge of the Supreme Court in Alavi Haji V. Muhammed (2007 (3) KLT 772007 (3) KLT 77 ) the contention with respect to the non receipt of notice has no validity, as in this case it is the same position as of a person who has not paid the amount within 15 days of the receipt of the summons as in the case mentioned in Alavi Haji's case (op.cit). It is the settled proposition that the notice sent on correct address would be sufficient compliance of proviso(b) to Section 138 [See Raja Kumari v. Subbarama Naidu (2004 (3) KLT 799)]2004 (3) KLT 7992004 ILO SC 9005. However, the court also held that the complainant is not entitled to initiate proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 as the hire purchase agreement in this regard provides for other remedies. The counsel for the revision petitioner has pointed out that the decision in Sudha Beevi v. State of Kerala (2004 (2) KLT 746)2004 (2) KLT 746 would not be applicable to the facts of the instant case as the terms of the agreement are different.In the circumstances, I find that the entire matter is liable to be reconsidered. The finding of the court below is set aside and the matter is remitted back to the court below for fresh disposal after permitting the parties to adduce further evidence if they so desire. The parties shall appear before the court below on 18.08.2007.Order accordingly"

Since the cheque amount was equal to the fine amount, I reduce the sentence while confirming the conviction. Sentence is modified as fine of Rs.7, 500/-. He has already suffered sentence. With the above modification of the sentence this revision petition is partly allowed.Petition partly allowed"

He was laid up on account of viral fever. A medical certificate was filed before the learned Magistrate. The learned Magistrate evidently considering the pendency of the old matter did not entertain the said application. The application was rejected and a non bailable warrant was issued against the petitioner and notices were issued to the sureties. The petitioner has come to this Court aggrieved by the said order. The petitioner was really ill that is why the application was made. The learned Magistrate should not have dismissed that application and must have given an opportunity to appear on the next date of posting. The petitioner is a doctor. He is willing to appear before the learned Magistrate personally on the next date of posting, that is on 20.8.07. Till that date warrant of arrest may not be executed and the learned Magistrate may be permitted to dispose of the application which is to be filed by the petitioner on the next date of posting, it is prayed.2. In these circumstances explained, I am satisfied that appropriate directions can be issued. The petitioner shall appear before the learned Magistrate on 20.08.07. Till then non bailable warrant against the petitioner cannot be executed. If the petitioner applies for bail on such surrender the learned Magistrate must consider the said application and pass appropriate orders on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously- on the date of surrender itself.3.

The matter has reached the stage of hearing arguments now. The petitioner filed an application to forward the cheque to the expert. The learned Magistrate, by Annexure A5 order took the view that it is not necessary to send the cheque to the expert.2. The petitioner claims to be aggrieved by the impugned order. The petitioner wants this court to invoke the extraordinary inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to interfere with Annexure A5 order.3. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner. I have perused the impugned order. I must alertly remind myself that I am called upon to invoke and exercise the extraordinary inherent powers under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Such jurisdiction has to be invoked sparingly and in exceptional circumstances in aid of justice. Has justice failed? Has there been miscarriage of justice? Has there been abuse of the process of court? These are the questions this court will be concerned with while considering the prayer for invocation of the jurisdiction under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973.4. The law frowns upon challenge against interlocutory orders during the pendency of the criminal proceedings. This policy of the law is reflected clearly in the embargo under Section 397(2) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Ordinarily and normally an interim order must wait for its challenge along with final order/judgment to be passed in that proceedings.5. Exceptions are possible. But having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am not at all persuaded to agree that this is a fit case where such extraordinary inherent jurisdiction can and ought to be invoked.6. This petition is accordingly dismissed. But I may hasten to observe that I have not chosen to express any opinion on merits on the challenge against the impugned order. I have only chosen to take the view that the order does not warrant interference by invoking the jurisdiction under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The petitioner shall be entitled to raise all his contentions before the learned Magistrate. The petitioner shall also be entitled to challenge the impugned order - Annexure A5 on merits, if such challenge be necessary after the judgment is pronounced in the trial against him.Petition dismissed"

According to the petitioners, they are absolutely innocent. Their failure/omission to appear earlier was not wilful or deliberate. According to the petitioners, only an amount of Rs.1, 00, 000/- is due to be paid to the complainant now. The petitioners are willing to pay that amounts. The petitioners want some time to make the payment and settle the disputes. In these circumstances, the petitioners may be permitted to deposit the balance amount of Rs.1, 00, 000/- within the stipulated period of time and the proceedings against the petitioners may be quashed.3. I find absolutely no merit in the prayer. Subsequent discharge of the liability after commencement of the proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 will not obliterate the culpable liability under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The petitioners must appear before the learned Magistrate and seek regular bail. They can certainly apply for exemption from personal appearance thereafter. The learned Magistrate must consider such application for bail on merits and in accordance with law.4. If the petitioners surrender before the learned Magistrate and apply for bail, the learned Magistrate must consider such application on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously - on the date of surrender itself.5. This petition is in these circumstances dismissed with the above observations/directions.Petition dismissed"

In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in S.T. No. 688 of 2003 on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvananthapuram challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor. Even though the 1st respondent complainant was duly served, it has not chosen to enter appearance.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re- iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. The counsel for the revision petitioner submits that the revision petitioner had produced Exts. D1 and D2 receipts by which the amounts covered by Exts. P2 to P4 cheques were repaid. The court below were therefore requested to take a lenient view with regard to the sentence to be imposed on him. However, the courts below took the view that those payments were made after the complainant had taken legal steps.5. There was no dispute before the courts below that the cheque amounts have been discharged as per the payments evidenced by Exts. D1 and D2. If so the above payment need only be treated as compensation under Section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 Hence, I set aside the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner by the courts below and hold that the payments effected as evidenced by Exts.D1 and D2 receipts could constitute compensation payable to the complainant under Section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The petitioner shall suffer imprisonment till the rising of the court for which purpose he shall surrender before the court below on 17.11.2007.5. Amount, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE K. R. UDAYABHANU1. The appellant is the complainant in S.T.No.3189/96 with respect to the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 which stands dismissed and the accused acquitted.2. A1 was no more at the time of trial itself. The complainant's case is that a sum of Rs.60, 000/- was borrowed from him by the accused on 24.3.1995 and towards discharge of the same, the impugned cheque was issued which when presented got dishonoured for want of funds in the account of the accused. The lawyer notice sent demanding payment was not replied to nor was any amount paid.3. The evidence adduced in the matter consisted the testimony of PWs' 1 to 3 and Exts. P1 to P10. The defence examined DW1 and DW2 of whom DW2 is the second accused himself and marked Exts. D1 to D4.4. The case of the defence is that only a sum of Rs.20, 000/- was borrowed and out of which Rs.19, 000/- was repaid and that there was a dispute with respect to the interest due and hence the blank cheque issued at the time of the borrowal has been misused by incorporating the amount of Rs.60, 000/-. According to the defence at the time of the transaction a pro-note was executed, the original of which according to the accused is with the complainant. According to the defence, it is the case that in the agreement the amount is mentioned as Rs.40, 000/-. They have also produced the copy of the agreement, i.e., Ext. D1, Ext. D2 photo copy of the blank cheque, Ext. D3 reply notice sent raising the above contentions which was received by the complainant who is the brother of the accused after filing of the complaint and Ext. D4 acknowledgment card. The court below has relied on certain circumstances that has brought out in the evidence in order to non suit the complaint. The relevant fact is that the cheque was presented just on the brink of the expiry of the validity of the date of the cheque. The cheque dated 25.8.1995 was presented on 15.2.1996. There is no explanation for not presenting the cheque at about six months after the date of the cheque. The above circumstance is fortified by the fact that Ext. D1 photo copy of the agreement which is dated 24.3.1995 is the pro-note that support the defence case and Ext. D1 contains the cheque number as well. The photocopy of the blank cheque is Ext. D2. The lower court has also noted that the writings of the details in the cheque is different from signature i.e., with respect to the ink used. It was on the basis of the cumulative effect of the entire circumstances that court found that the defence has established a probable case and that the complainant has failed to establish the execution of the cheque.5. In the above circumstances, I find no reason to interfere in the findings of the court below in exercise of the appellate jurisdiction against acquittal.The appeal is dismissed.Appeal dismissed"

No. 34936 of 1999, dated 3-12-2001 acquitting the respondent of the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.2. The essential facts leading upto this appeal with reference to the rank of the parties before the Trial Court are as follows.-The complainant-appellant herein filed a complaint under Section 200 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973, before the XVI Additional CMM, Bangalore averring that the accused-respondent had taken a loan of Rs. 60, 000/- i.e., Rs. 10, 000/- at the first instance and subsequently Rs. 50, 000/- during 1998 for the purpose of running Garment Factory near Sunkadakatte Main Road by promising that she would pay the said sum within 2 to 3 months. When the complainant demanded repayment of the said sum, the respondent issued two cheques for Rs. 10, 000/- in the first instance and Rs. 50, 000/- during October 1998. The accused had requested to postpone the presentation of the cheque. The complainant waited and presented the cheque during the first week of 1998 i.e., on 9-12-1998 through SB Account in Syndicate Bank, Sirsi Road Branch, Bangalore and the same was returned with Bank shara 'insufficient funds' on 10-12-1998. The said fact was informed to the accused by issuing a legal notice dated 18-12-1998. The notice was sent through RPAD and Certificate of Posting. Even though the accused received the notice through certificate of posting and inspite of the intimation by the postal authorities, she did not collect the registered post, which has been returned with shara \"Intimation delivered and not collected\". The accused has neither complied with the legal notice nor has paid the amount of the cheque and wherefore, the complaint.3. The learned Additional CMM recorded the sworn statement of the accused and issued summons to the accused. The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. On behalf of the complainant, she was examined as P.W. 1 and got marked Exs. P. 1 to P. 4. On behalf of the accused, the accused was examined as D.W. 1 and got marked Exs. D. 1 to D. 3. The statement of the accused was recorded under Section 313 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The defence of the accused was one of denial. The Trial Court after considering the contention of the parties and the material on record held that the complainant has not proved service of notice of dishonour on the respondent and complaint is not got marked and wherefore the complainant has failed to prove that the respondent has committed the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and accordingly acquitted the respondent of having committed the said offence by its judgment dated 3-12-2001. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of acquittal, the complainant has presented this appeal.4. Learned Counsel appearing for the complainant submitted that both the grounds on which the Trial Court has proceeded to acquit the accused are erroneous. Learned Counsel further submitted that when the notice was sent to the correct address of the respondent and it was not claimed by the respondent and the notice was also sent through certificate of posting, the notice should have been deemed to have been served on the respondent in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of if. Bhaskaran v Sankaran Vaidhyan Balan and Another (AIR 1.999 SC 3762 : (1999)7 SCC 5101999 (7) SCC 5101999 ILO SC 755 : 1999 Cri. L.J. 46061999 CrLJ 4606 (SC)). Further, since the complaint is not got marked, in view of the decision of this Court in G. Premdas v Venkataram (2001(1) KCCR 437), the accused is entitled to be acquitted as the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is not proved. Learned Counsel has relied upon the Division Bench decision of this Court in V. Satyanarayana v Mis. Sandeep Enterprises, Bangalore (2004(7) Kar. L.J. 5412004 (7) KarLJ 5412004 ILO KAR 122 (DB) : 2004(4) KCCR 2758 (DB)), wherein it has been held that the complaint need not be got marked as a document as it forms part of the record and non-marking is not fatal to the complainant's case. The learned Counsel has also relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of K.N. Beena v Muniyappan and Another (AIR 2001 SC 28952001 AIR(SC) 28952001 ILO SC 19809 : (2001) 8 SCC 4582001 (8) SCC 4582001 ILO SC 19809 : 2002 SCC (Cri) 14)2002 SCC(Cr) 142001 ILO SC 19809, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that if the notice is issued to the correct address of the respondent and it is not claimed, the notice should be deemed to have been served. Learned Counsel further submitted that in view of the presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and the production of any material to rebut the said presumption by the respondent, the Trial Court ought to have convicted the respondent and wherefore the judgment of acquittal is liable to be set aside.5. On the other hand, the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent submitted that the respondent has taken the defence that she had issued two blank cheques and on 4-2-1998, she had pledged the gold ornaments and obtained Rs. 43, 000/- from Lalchand Premchand Mutha and Company and paid to the complainant and the Pawn ticket is signed by the complainant. The respondent further contends that even after payment of the cheque amount, the complainant did not return the cheques. The accused-respondent had also issued notice on 5-10-1998 as per Ex. D. 2 under certificate of posting for return of the disputed cheques and despite service of notice, the complainant has presented the cheques and therefore, there is non-compliance of the provisions of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.6. Having regard to the contentions urged by the learned Counsel for the parties, the point that arises for consideration in this appeal are:1. Whether the judgment of acquittal passed by the Trial Court calls for interference in appeal?2. Whether the complainant has proved that the respondent-accused has committed the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act?3. What order?and I answer the above points as follows.-(1) in the affirmative;(2) in the affirmative;(3) as per the final order for the following reasons:I have been taken through the oral and documentary evidence adduced by the complainant and the respondent before the Trial Court. It is clear from the perusal of the judgment passed by the Trial Court that the Trial Court has proceeded to hold that the complainant has failed to prove that the respondent has committed the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act as she has failed to prove that after dishonour of the cheque, notice Ex. P. 3 was served upon the respondent and the complainant has neither produced the letter issued by the postal authority nor has examined the postal authorities and also, the returned postal cover does not bear the seal or signature of the postal authorities. The other ground upon which the Trial Court has held that the complainant has failed to prove that the respondent has committed the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act in that the complaint is not got marked and wherefore in view of the decision of this Court rendered by the Single Judge of this Court, the respondent is entitled to be acquitted and both the reasons assigned by the Trial Court are erroneous. The decision relied upon by the Trial Court regarding the marking of the complaint has been overruled by the Division Bench of this Court in V. Satyanarayana's case, wherein, it is clearly held that complaint forms part of the record and it need not be marked and non-marking is not fatal to the complainant's case and wherefore the reasons assigned by the Trial Court that the complaint is not got marked cannot be sustained and the other ground assigned by the Trial Court regarding non-service of notice Ex. P. 3 is also erroneous in view of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of K. Bhaskaran, wherein it has held that though the notice sent by registered post is returned as 'unclaimed', the notice should be presumed to have been served if it is sent to the correct address of the respondent. It is clear from the evidence of D.W. 1 that it is true that she has borrowed money from the complainant and it is also true that she has issued cheque when the complainant demanded the amount. In the circumstances, it is clear that the said facts elicited in the cross-examination of D.W. 1 would clearly rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and no material is produced to rebut the said presumption. The mere fact that she has produced a pawn ticket would not by itself show that the amount was repaid to the complainant as no material is produced in that behalf and so far as notice Ex. D. 2 is concerned, it is clear that the said fact is not suggested to D.W. 1 in her cross-examination nor stated while answering the question framed under Section 313 of the Cr. P.C. Under the circumstances, it must be held that all the ingredients of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 are proved and the complainant has proved that the respondent has committed the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 Accordingly, I answer points 1 and 2. The offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is punishable with imprisonment which may extend to six months with fine which may extend to twice the amount of cheque. Having regard to the circumstances under which the offence has been committed as also the facts and circumstances of the case, the interest of justice would be met by sentencing the respondent-accused to pay a fine of Rs. 53, 000/-and out of the fine amount, Rs. 50, 000/- shall be paid as compensation by the respondent being the cheque amount to the complainant. Accordingly, I pass the following.-ORDERThe appeal is allowed. The judgment of acquittal passed by the XVI Additional CMM, Bangalore, dated 3-12-2001 is set aside and the respondent is convicted of having committed the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881and is sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 53, 000/-, in default of payment of fine, to undergo simple imprisonment for six months out of the fine amount Rs. 50, 000/- shall be paid as compensation to the complainant being the cheque amount.Appeal allowed"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE V. K. MOHANAN1. The appellant herein is the complainant in C.C.No.297 of 1996 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Aluva which is a case instituted upon a private complaint for an offence under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to for short as 'the N.I. Act' only). As per the judgment dated 19.9.1998 in C.C.No.297 of 1996 of the Trial Court, the accused was found guilty under S. 138 of the N.I. Act and he was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for six months. Challenging the above conviction and sentence, the accused preferred an appeal as Crl.Appeal No.5 of 1999 (originally it was numbered as Crl.A. No. 387/98 of the Sessions Court, Ernakulam). As per the judgment dated 1.6.2000 in Crl.Appeal No.5 of 1999, the Additional Sessions Judge, North Paravur allowed the appeal setting aside the conviction and sentence of the Trial Court. Challenging the above order of the lower Appellate Court, the complainant initially filed Crl.M.C.No.4122 of 2000 for leave of this Court which was granted on 11.8.2000 and thus, this appeal is preferred against the judgment of the lower Appellate Court.2. The case of the appellant/complainant is that the accused borrowed a sum of Rs.2 lakhs from the complainant promising to repay the same amount on demand for which Ext.Pl cheque dated 10.11.1995 was issued. The cheque was drawn from the account maintained by the accused in the Angamaly Branch of Federal Bank Limited. On presentation of the cheque for encashment, the same was returned on 12.12.1995 for the reason 'funds insufficient'. Consequently, the \"complainant had caused to send a lawyer notice on 22.12.1995 which was received by the accused. Then the accused sent a reply denying the transaction and according to the complainant, it was only a false allegation and contention. Thus, according to the complainant, though a statutory notice was issued, no payment was effected within the statutory period and hence the accused has committed the offence punishable under S. 138 of the N.I.Act. Therefore, he approached the Trial Court by filing complaint under S. 138 of the N.I.Act.3. During trial, Pws.1 to 3 were examined as prosecution witnesses and Exts.Pl to P7 were marked as documentary evidence on the side of the complainant. On the side of defence, Dws.1 and 2 were examined and Exts. D1 and D2 were marked as documentary evidence. After appreciation of the evidence and materials on records, the Trial Court was of the opinion that Ext.Pl cheque was issued in discharge of the debt, but the same was returned for want of sufficient funds and the complainant had complied with all legal formalities and therefore, it was found that the accused is guilty of the offence under S.138 of the N.I.Act.4. On appeal, at the instance of the accused, the lower Appellate Court had found that the complainant had miserably failed to prove the passing of consideration and merely because of the admission of signature in the cheque, it could not be said that the execution of cheque was proved. Relying upon certain decisions, the lower Appellate Court had held that though the accused had admitted his signature in the cheque, in all other respect it was a blank cheque, and what was admitted was the signature alone and thus, that would amount to denial of execution of cheque. In support of the above conclusion, the lower Appellate Court had relied upon certain materials which are available on record. On analysis and application of S.118(a) of the N.I.Act, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the lower Appellate Court had come to a conclusion that the appellant/complainant had failed to discharge the initial burden regarding the execution of the cheque and therefore, the presumption under S. 118(a) of the N.I.Act was not available to him. Further, on an appreciation of the evidence and on the basis of materials on record, the lower Appellate Court had held that since the very execution of the cheque was denied by the accused, the complainant could not seek the aid of presumption available under S.139 of the N.I.Act. It was also found by the court below, that the complainant/appellant would not come within the meaning of 'holder' of promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque, as two conditions mentioned in S.8 of the N.I. Act had not been satisfied conjunctively. The lower Appellate Court had specifically found that there was no evidence that the said cheque was issued for payment of any amount to the complainant in discharge of any debt or liability. Therefore, it was found that Ext. P1 cannot be termed as a cheque of the nature referred to under S.138 of the N.I.Act. Hence, according to the court below, the complainant is not entitled to the presumption available under S.139 of the N.I.Act. The lower Appellate Court had also found that the dishonour of Ext.P1 cheque for want of sufficient funds in the account on which it was drawn, issuance of notice demanding payment of Ext.Pl cheque, non-payment of the amount even after receipt of notice by the accused etc. did not assume any importance in the light of the earlier findings of the court. Thus, the lower Appellate Court had specifically found that the complainant had failed to make out a case punishable under S. 138 of the N.I. Act and accordingly, the conviction and sentence imposed against the accused had been set aside. Aggrieved by the above findings, appellant/complainant has filed this appeal.5. I have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned counsel for the first respondent as also the learned Public Prosecutor.6. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant strenuously submits that the lower Appellate Court erred in acquitting the accused on the basis of the decisions which were referred to in the judgment since those judgments were pertaining to the period before the amendment brought to the N.I.Act. According to counsel, Chapter XVII is newly introduced, incorporating penal provision and therefore, all the decisions referred to by the lower court are not useful as those decisions were prior to the newly introduced chapter mentioned above. Going by the memorandum of Appeal also, it appeal's that the main ground is ground No.(B) which says that the lower Appellate Court went wrong in finding that Ext. P1 cheque is not properly executed and it is further stated that the court came to such conclusion relying on decision prior to the amendment of N.I. Act incorporating penal provisions to punish for issuing cheque without keeping the sufficient funds. All other grounds in the memorandum of appeal are general. The appellant's counsel further submits that the statutory presumption under Ss. 118(a) and 139 are in favour of the complainant/appellant and those presumptions were not rebutted by the accused by cogent evidence. Hence, it is argued that on the failure of the accused to rebut the presumption, as rightly done by the Trial Court, the lower Appellate Court ought to have confirmed the conviction and the sentence instead of acquitting him. In support of the above contentions, the counsel for the appellant placed reliance on various decisions.7. After an elaborate consideration of the entire materials available on record, the Sessions Court had held that the benefits of presumption available under Ss. 118(a) and 139 were not available to the complainant, simply for the reason that Ext.Pl cheque contained the signature of the accused, especially when the complainant failed to establish the execution of the cheque and also the passing of consideration. The lower Appellate Court also held that the complainant could not be termed as a holder. Thus the lower Appellate Court came to a conclusion that no offence under S. 138 of the N.I. Act is established against the accused and therefore, the order of conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court were set aside and the accused was accordingly acquitted.8. It is the above order of acquittal challenged in this appeal and it is argued that the above order of acquittal shall be set aside and the order of conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court shall be confirmed.9. Before going into the above legal question, it would be beneficial to examine the facts involved in the case so as to appreciate the legal question in its correct perspective.10. The only case put forward by the complainant in his complaint is that the accused had borrowed a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs from the complainant for his business purpose with a promise that the amount would be repaid on demand by the complainant and thus, the cheque in question was issued, which was dishonoured when presented for encashment for the reason that 'funds insufficient'. Thus according to the complainant, statutory notice was sent, which was also not honoured and no amount was paid within the stipulated time and therefore, he approached the Trial Court by filing the complaint. During his chief examination, nothing more was stated and he had strictly deposed only in accordance with the versions contained in the complaint. During the cross-examination, he had made certain improvements and stated that he had acquaintance with the accused for 4 to 5 years through one Viswan at Angamaly and they were in good relations. On further cross-examination, he had deposed that the accused had started a company viz., New India Credit Capitals Investment Private Limited. On a pointed question as to whether the complainant was the Director of the company, he answered positively. The company was started as Manchiyam company. To several questions regarding the company, the complainant had answered that the company is not working at present and it is in a standstill. They have decided to give back the share to the share holders. To the specific question as to whether the company has sufficient asset for repaying the share value to the share holders, the answer was 'not known'. To another question as to whether a motor bike was pledged for Rs.5000/-for the company purpose, he stated, he did not know.11. The specific case put forward by the accused is that he was the Managing Director of the above company and the complainant was one of the Directors. In order to meet the monetary need of the company, they had decided to pledge a motor bike in a financial institution at Perumbavoor for Rs.5000/- and towards the security for the said transaction, the accused had entrusted a blank cheque i.e., Ext.Pl with the complainant, which is referred to in the above complaint. From the above facts, it is crystal clear that both the complainant as well as accused are not strangers or they are not belonging to rival business groups, but they were having much acquaintance with each other and they were together in a company of which the complainant is one of the Directors and the accused was the Managing Director of the same company. The entire transaction alleged in the complaint has to be examined in the above factual background. It is pertinent to note that the complainant did not mention any of those facts in the complaint and even during his chief examination. The case of the complainant is that Ext. P1 cheque, bearing the signature of the accused, was dishonoured when it was presented for encashment and no amount was paid within the statutory period though a formal demand was made and therefore, the accused has committed the offence under S.138 of the N.I.Act.12. It is true that when the cheque in question contained the signature of the account holder, it is for the accused to explain the same, but merely because Ext.P1 cheque contained the signature of the account holder or the accused, it cannot be said that the same was executed by him. In this case, it is relevant to note that the accused has specifically denied the execution of the cheque and the case advanced by him is that Ext.Pl cheque was entrusted with the complainant and the cheque contained nothing more than his signature. So, on the basis of the above admission, counsel for the appellant/complainant submits that the complainant is entitled to get the benefit of presumption envisaged by Ss. 118(a) and 139 of the N.I.Act. On the other hand, counsel for the respondent/accused submitted that the presumption regarding consideration can be drawn under S. 118(a) only when the execution is proved and therefore, it is clear that passing of consideration and the existence of debt are not proved by the complainant. No doubt, it is the duty of the complainant to establish all the ingredients of S. 138 of the N.I. Act in order to canvass a conviction against the accused. S.138 contained in Chapter XVII of the N.I.Act reads thus:-\"138. Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account.-Where any cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by him with a banker for payment of any amount of money to another person from out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability, is returned by the bank unpaid, either because of the amount of money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with that bank, such person shall be deemed to have committed an offence and shall, without prejudice to any other provisions of this Act. be punished with imprisonment for [a term which may be extended to two years], or with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both:Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply unless- \"(a) the cheque has been presented to the bank within a period of six months from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier;(b) the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as the case may be, makes a demand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice in writing, to the drawer of the cheque, [within thirty days] of the receipt of information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid; and(c) the drawer of such cheque fails to make the payment of the said amount of money to the payee or, as the case may be, to the holder in due course of the cheque, within fifteen days of the receipt of the said notice, \"Explanation.- -For the purposes of this section, \"debt or other liability\" means a legally enforceable debt or other liability.)Going by S. 138 of the'N.I.Act, it can be seen that 'a drawing of cheque' by a person on an account mai ntained by him with the banker for payment of any amount of money to another person from out of that account 'for the discharge', in whole or in part, 'of any debtor other liability' are two importantingredients, especially in the back ground of this case. In the decision reported in Ch.Birbal Singh v. Harphool Khan (AIR 1976 All.23)1976 AIR(All) 23, it was held that execution of documents consists of signing of the document written out, read over and under stood and does notconsistof merely signing of ablank paper. In another decision reported in Thakurlal v. Ramadhar(1968 ALJ 4801968 ALJ 480), it had been held that mere admission of putting of signature and thumb mark on a blank sheet of paper is not admission of execution of the document. In the present case, the accused did not dispute the signature in Ext. P1 cheque, but his specific case is that he had entrusted with the complainant Ext.Pl blank cheque which contained his signature. It is brought out through evidence that the complainant does not remember that when Ext.P1 cheque was given to the accused. According to him, the amount and the date shown in the cheque might have been written by any member of the family of the accused or his friend. The complainant is also not aware as in whose handwriting, the cheque was written. Therefore, it is crystal clear that the complainant is not aware of the execution of Ext.Pl cheque. When the execution of the cheque is denied by the accused, it is for the complainant to establish the same. In the absence of any positive evidence regarding the execution of the cheque by the accused, it is to be held that the accused had issued only blank cheque and the same was not executed by him. Simply because the cheque contained the signature of the accused, it cannot be said that the cheque was drawn by the accused as contemplated by S. 138 of the N.I. Act.13. The contentions of the appellant that the decisions referred to and relied on by the court below are of prior to the amendment to the N.I. Act and hence the court below has committed a wrong, and not legally correct and not acceptable. It is beyond the scope of debate that the mode of execution of an instrument and its legal validity and sanctity including the presumption under S. 118 of the N.I. Act are same, whether it is executed before or after the introduction of the new Chapter, namely Chapter XVII into the N.I. Act.14. It is also relevant to note that the complainant has miserably failed to prove . the passing of any consideration and also any legally enforceable debt or liability.15. It is pertinent to note that going by the provision namely, S.138 of the N.I.Act, it can be seen that the legislature has employed certain words cautiously and not without any meaning. The word employed in S.138 viz., 'drawn', 'discharge of any debt or other liability' are conveying the message of the legislature, through which we can understand the intention of the legislature. So while interpreting the provisions or the word, the court has to give effect the intention of legislature. At any stretch of imagination, it cannot be said that putting signature on the blank cheque is equivalent to the word 'drawn' used in S.138 of the N.I.Act. Therefore, the word 'drawn' used in S.138 has to be understood as 'execution' of cheque. In a decision reported in Johnson Scaria v. State of Kerala (2006 (4) KLT 290)2006 (4) KLT 290, this Court has held \"the burden is always on the prosecution to prove the offence against an indictee in all prosecutions and a prosecution under S.138 of the N.I.Act is no exception to that general rule. Execution and issue of the cheque have to be proved to draw the presumption under S. 139 and S. 139 does not shift the burden to prove execution and issue of the cheque.\" In the same decision, it is further held that \"admission of signature in a cheque goes a long way to prove due execution. Possession of the cheque by the complainant similarly goes a long way to prove issue of the cheque. The burden rests on the complainant to prove execution and issue. But, under S.114 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, appropriate inferences and presumptions can be drawn in each case on the question of execution and issue of the cheque depending on the evidence available and explanations offered.\" In the present case, on an appreciation of entire factual situation and the materials on record, it cannot be said that the complainant has discharged his burden in proving the execution of Ext.Pl cheque and therefore, I am fully endorsing the reason given by the lower Appellate Court for coming to the conclusion that the complainant has failed to prove the execution of Ext.P1 cheque.16. Another point argued by counsel for the appellant is that he is entitled to get the benefit of presumption envisaged by S. 118 of the N.I. Act. Stressing on the admission at the side of the defence regarding the signature on Ext.Pl cheque, the counsel argued that under S. 118(a) of the N.LAct, it is to be presumed that consideration has passed during the transaction and therefore, the reasoning given by the court below is unacceptable and liable to be rejected. In the present case, PW-1 himself was not aware of the actual transaction. He does not know who filled up the blank cheque. He does not know the author of the handwriting appearing in Ext.Pl cheque. He does not know when Ext.Pl cheque was issued. Only in the cross examination, he has stated regarding the payment made by 2, 3 instalments. Neither in the complaint nor during chief examination, the complainant has got a case that the consideration was passed by way of instalments. On the basis of the above materials on evidence, we have to examine the execution of the cheque as stated earlier, PW-1 complainant has miserably failed to prove the execution of the cheque itself and therefore, the presumption under S. 118(a) of the N.LAct regarding the consideration is not available to the appellant/ complainant. On the basis of the decision reported in General Auto Sales v. Vijayalakshmi (2005 (1) KLT 4782005 (1) KLT 478), the counsel for the appellant argued that even if a blank cheque has been given towards the liability or even as security, when liability is assessed and quantified, if cheque is filled up and presented to Bank, the person who had drawn cheque cannot avoid the criminal liability arising out of S. 138 of the N.I.Act.17. The facts involved in the above case is entirely different from the present one. In that case, it is relevant to note that there was a settlement between the complainant and the accused and the cheque was drawn for a fixed amount towards the amount due as found in the settlement. Here the transaction itself is denied and the case set up by the accused is that the cheque was given for security for availing loan by pledging a bike of the company. Therefore, the above decision is not helpful for the appellant. Another decision relied on by the counsel for the petitioner is reported in R.Sivaraman v. The State of Kerala & Ors. (2006 (3) KLT SN 822006 (3) KLT 82 (CNo. 117) = 2006 (3) KLJ 922006 (3) KLJ 92) wherein this Court has held \"the Court has to presume that the cheque had been issued for a debt or liability. It is also held in the very decision that the presumption is rebuttable, the burden of proving that the cheque had not been issued in discharge of a debt or liability is on the accused. In the present case, first of all, the execution of the cheque was not proved and therefore, the presumption under S. 139 is not available in favour of the complainant/appellant. The materials available on records are not sufficient to show the discharge of the initial burden on the complainant/appellant to establish a presumption under S. 139. The burden of rebutting the presumption will be shifted to the accused only when the complainant/appellant has discharged his initial burden. A decision reported in Johnson Scaria v. State of Kerala (2006 (4) KLT 290)2006 (4) KLT 290 is cited by the appellant for canvassing the proposition that law does not mandate proof of original transaction or existence of original consideration and the Courts are not bound to adjudicate on the liability under the cheque in dispute. It is true that the court is not bound to adjudicate on the liability under the cheque in dispute, but when the court is confronted with the question regarding the penal liability arising under S. 138 of the N.I. Act, especially when the execution of the cheque itself is disputed and not proved, the court has to consider the transaction for arriving at a safe conclusion. In the present case, the execution itself is not proved by the complainant and therefore, the presumption under S.139 is not available to him. Even if the initial burden is discharged by the complainant, the accused can rebut the presumption either by adducing direct evidence or even by relying on broad improbabilities of the prosecution case including the improbable evidence of the prosecution. Therefore, all the factual circumstances involved in a particular case could have been relied on by the accused to discharge his burden. The Apex Court, in a decision reported in Kamala S. v. Vidhyadharan M.J. & Anr. (2007 (3) KLT 8612007 (3) KLT 861 (SC) = (2007) 5 SCC 264))2007 (5) SCC 264, has held that presumption under Ss. 139 and 118 (a) is rebuttable and further held that burden on accused to rebut the presumption can be discharged by preponderance of probabilities and Court can draw inference from material brought on record as well as circumstances relied upon by the accused. In the present case, going by the materials and evidence on record and particularly the facts involved in the case, I am of the view that the appellant/complainant has miserably failed to establish his case beyond doubt.18. As I stated earlier, this is an appeal preferred against the order of acquittal of the lower Appellate Court. This Court while exercising the appellate jurisdiction cannot merely substitute a view unless there is sufficient reason to improbablise the finding of the lower Appellate Court or any patent illegality. In the facts and circumstances involved in the present case and the materials and findings on record, I have no hesitation to hold that the reasoning assigned by the lower Appellate Court for acquitting the accused is perfectly legal and valid and I find no reason to interfere with such order of acquittal. In this case, it is relevant to note that the parties were having prior acquaintance and they were part and parcel of one establishment and it cannot be ruled out, the possibilities of vexatious litigation due to personal animosity. I am constrained to draw such a presumption on the fact that though in the complaint, the allegation was for non-payment of Rs.2 lakhs and though the Trial Court has awarded only imprisonment as a sentence, the appellant/complainant has not chosen to prefer appeal against the insufficiency of sentence, in other words, there was no move from his side for realising the amount by way of fine or compensation by filing an appeal.In the light of the above facts and circumstances, there is no merit in the appeal and accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.Appeal dismissed"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE J. B. KOSHY1. Whether an offence under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 can be compounded after the confirmation of the conviction passed by the Magistrate Court, by the Appellate Court and High Court in revision ? Whether an order passed by the High Court in a criminal revision petition confirming the conviction can be nullified by the High Court in a petition filed under S.482 of Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 noticing subsequent compromise of the case by the contesting parties ? What is the effect of the non obstante clause 'notwithstanding anything contained in the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr.P.C)' in S. 147 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 ? These are the main questions to be considered in this case. In Sabu George v. Home Secretary (2007 (1) KLT 982)2007 (1) KLT 9822007 ILO KER 30, it was held by the learned Single Judge of this Court that offence under S.138 can be compounded even after confirmation of the conviction by the High Court in revision and considering the subsequent facts of compromise, necessary relief can be given in a petition under S.482 of the Cr.PC. by this Court. Another learned Single Judge of this Court expressed doubt about the correctness of the above decision and thus referred this matter to the Division Bench.2. Before answering the reference, we shall consider the facts of this case. A cheque issued by the accused for an amount of Rs.25, 000/- was dishonoured for \"insufficiency of funds\" and he faced charges under S. 138 of the N.I.Act. After trial, he was convicted by the Magistrate Court and sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for one year with a fine of Rs.5, 000/-. His conviction was confirmed in appeal, but sentence was modified and he was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for three months. In revision application, this Court by order dated 23.3.2007, confirmed the conviction but sentence was modified to imprisonment till rising of the court and to pay a compensation of Rs.25, 000/- under S.357(3) of Cr.P.C. Thereafter this petition was filed in May 2007 under S.482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the accused petitioner for the following reliefs: 1) to accept the ' compounding application jointly filed by the parties and (2) to return the fine amount of Rs.5, 000/- already deposited before the Magistrate Court. In the joint petition by the parties (accused and complainant) prayer is as follows:\"In the above circumstances and in the interest of justice, this Honourable Court may be pleased to permit the petitioners to compound the offence and acquit the 1 st petitioner.\"Counsel for the petitioner relied on the decision of Sabu George (supra) for allowing the petition. But Learned Single Judge was of the opinion that order of conviction became final by the order of the High Court and hence he cannot be acquitted in a petition under S.482 of Cr.P.C. and doubted the correctness of the above decision with the following observation:\"The legal effect of allowing this petition by invoking the inherentpower of this Court would be to efface the conviction entered and sentence passed by this Court in Crl.R.P.667/2000 which in the normal course could have been interfered with only by the Supreme Court in appropriate proceedings. Apart from the fact that the consequence which is sought to be avoided by the accused is not one flowing from the proceedings of an inferior court, the course now sought to be resorted to appears to be impermissible in the light of the decision of the Apex Court reported in Sankar Ramchandra Abhyankar v. Krishnaji Dattatraya Bapat (AIR 1970 SC 1)1970 AIR(SC) 11969 ILO SC 533. Moreover, a reading of sub Ss.4 (a), 4 (b), 5 and 6 of S.320 Cr.P.C. would indicate that compounding can be had only in a pending proceeding and with the permission or consent, as the case may be, of the court even if the offence is one compoundable without the permission of the Court. In the case of offences falling under sub-s.(2) of S.320 Cr.P.C. the very fact that those offences can be compounded only with the permission of the Court would suggest that some proceedings should be pending before the Court when the request to compound the offences is made and entertained. A proceeding which has culminated in a final order cannot, in my view, be revived by filing a compounding petition.\"3. In Sabu George's case, this Court has considered two petitions. In one case, after confirmation of conviction by this Court in revision petition (Cr.R.P.No.7/2004), Crl.M.A.No.8626/2006 was filed for compounding the case. Later Crl.MC.No.259/ 2007 was also filed under S .482 of the Cr.P.C. for compounding the case. In the next case, after confirmation of the conviction under S.138 of the N.I.Act, W.P.(C).No.34540/ 2006 was filed to compound the case. Court granted following reliefs:\"31. In both these cases, I find that an amount of Rs.2, 000/- is to be paid to the State as fine and in these circumstances the powers under S.482 Cr.P.C. can be invoked only subject to the condition that such amounts must be paid to the State by the respective petitioners. Such a stipulation shall ensure the interests of justice eminently.32. To sum up, I take the view that in a case falling under S.320(1) Crl.P.C. where there has been a post revision composition of the offence by the victim/complainant, the jurisdiction under S.482 Cr.P.C. (and of course Art.226/227 of the Constitution Of India, 1950) is in law available with the High Court and in a fit case, such powers can and ought to be invoked. The cases on hand are eminently fit cases where such jurisdiction ought to be invoked, I conclude.33. In the result, W.P.(C).34540 of 2006 and CrI.M.C.259 of 2007 are allowed. It is directed that the sentences imposed on the petitioners shall not be executed on condition that the petitioners deposit an amount of Rs.2000/- each before the learned Magistrates concerned within a period of 45 days from this date. In default of payment of the said amount of Rs.2000/- each, they shall undergo the default sentences approved in the respective orders in revision.34. Crl.M.A.No.8626 of 2006 in Crl.R.P.No.7 of 2004 is dismissed as unnecessary in view of the order in Crl.M.C.259 of 2007.\"4. Before answering the reference, we may extract S.320 of the Cr.P.C. as well as S.147 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.\"S.320: Compounding of offences:-(1) The offences punishable under the sections of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (45 of 1860) specified in the first two columns of the Table next following may be compounded by the persons mentioned in the third column of that Table:(Table)XXX XXX XXX(2) The offences punishable under the sections of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (45 of 1860), specified in the first two columns of the Table next following may, with the permission of the Court before which any prosecution for such offence is pending, be compounded by the persons mentioned in the third column of that table:-(Table)XXX XXX XXX(3) When, any offence is compoundable under this section, the abetment of such offence or an attempt to commit such offence (when such attempt is itself an offence) may be compounded in like manner.(4)(a) When the person who would otherwise be competent to compound an offence under this section is, under the age of eighteen years or is an idiot or a lunatic, any person competent to contract on his behalf, may, with the permission of the Court compound such offence.(b) When the person who would otherwise be competent to compound an offence under this section is dead, the legal representative, as defined in the Code Of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) of such person may, with the consent of the Court compound such offence.(5) When the accused has been committed for trial or when he has been convicted and an appeal is pending, no composition for the offence shall be allowed without the leave of the Court to which he is committed, or, as the case may be, before which the appeal is to be heard.(6) A High Court or Court of Session acting in the exercise of its powers of revision under S.401 may allow any person to compound any offence which such person is competent to compound under this section.(7) No offence shall be compounded if the accused is, by reason of a previous conviction, liable either to enhanced punishment or to a punishment of a different kind for such offence.(8) The composition of an offence under this section shall have the effect of an acquittal of the accused with whom the offence has been compounded.(9) No offence shall be compounded except as provided by this section.\" \"S.147:-- Offences to be compoundable:-Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), every offence punishable under this Act shall be compoundable.5. S. 147 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 was incorporated by Negotiable Instruments (Amendment And Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002. The contention of the petitioner is that S. 147 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 enables the parties to compound the offence under this Act at any time and there is no bar in compounding the case, after conviction is confirmed by the highest court. It is also stated that because of the non obstinate clause used in the beginning of the Section, application of Criminal Procedure Code is totally excluded. Therefore Ss.320 and 362 of Cr.P.C. have to be ignored and once the matter is settled, on a petition under S.482 of Cr.P.C, by using inherent powers, this Court can accept the compounding and nullify the conviction and sentence already passed by the Court and attained finality. It was also argued that even before S. 147 was enacted, parties had power to settle the offences under N.I.Act and compound the offence. For accepting the compounding petition by the court, no proceedings need be pending before the court. Once the contesting parties have compromised the matter, in the absence of any prohibiting clause, court is bound to accept the same. It was further argued that though criminal in nature, complaint under S. 138 is a private dispute between the parties for a speedy recovery and dispute can be compromised at any time whether before conviction and after conviction. But it cannot be stated that S.138 was incorporated only as a means for speedy recovery of a civil dispute. Ss. 138 to 142 was inserted by the Banking Public Financial Institutions and Negotiable Instruments Laws (Amendment) Act, 1988. The objects, reasons and preamble of the above Act show that apart from providing a speedy remedy, the object of bringing S. 138 on the statute appears to be to inculcate faith in the efficacy of banking operations and credibility in transacting business on negotiable instruments and it is essential for the economic development of the country as held by the Apex Court in M/s. Electronics Trade and Technology Development Corporation Limited, Secunderabad v. M/s. lndian Technologists and Engineers (Electronics) Pvt. Ltd. &Anr.(AIR 1996 SC2339)1996 AIR(SC) 23391996 ILO SC 1120.6. The expressions 'compromise' and 'compounding' are not synonyms in criminal jurisprudence even though these expressions are usually used without any distinction. Any disputes can be compromised between the parties if the terms are not illegal. But only a compoundable offence allowed by law can be compounded. A dispute relating to a crime can be compromised even before case is registered, and in that case, victim of the crime may refuse to file a complaint. But if inspite of compromise, if he files a complaint and court finds that what is compromised is a compoundable offence, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case, Magistrate can refuse to take cognizance, or acquit the accused as offence was compounded or the complaint can be quashed in a proceedings under S.482. If an offence which is not compoundable under law is compromised, Magistrate can ignore the same and proceed with the crime. But once a crime is registered and court takes cognizance of the case, the offence can be compounded only as provided under S.320 Cr.P.C. Offence under Table 1 can be compounded without previous permission of the court and Table II with previous permission. But it will have the effect of acquittal only when it is accepted by the concerned court. S.320 only deals with compounding of offence, pending either before the Trial Court or before the Appellate Court or revisional court. Compromise is defined in Black's Law Dictionary, Seventh Edition, as follows:\"Compromise:1. An agreement between two or more persons to settle matters in dispute between them.2. A debtor's partial payment coupled with the creditor's promise not to claim the rest of the amount due or claimed.\"In Stroud's Judicial Dictionary of words and phrases (Sixth Edition), compromise is defined as follows:\"Compromise: \"'Compromise', is a mutual promise of two or more parties there are at controversie\" (Termes de la Ley).\"A compromise takes place when there is a question of doubt, and the parties agree not to try it out, but to settle it between themselves by a give-and-take arrangement\" (per Kay L.J., Hudders field Bank v. Lister (1895) 2 Ch. 285)1895 (2) Ch 285\"I understand 'compromise' [Legal Aid and Advice Act 1949 (c.51), s.1 (5)] to mean an agreement to settle an action or threatened action. It may be an agreement to apply for a consent judgment.........Or it may be an agreement that the dispute shall be settled on certain terms..........Or it may be an agreement to avoid a threatened action\" (per Pearson J., Marshall v. Barnes and Fitzpatrick (1953) 1 All E.R. 970)1953 (1) AllER 9701953 ILO QBD 6.\"Compounding is defined in Black's Law Dictionary, Seventh Edition, as\"Compounding a crime:- The offence of either agreeing not to prosecute a crime that one knows has been committed or agreeing to hamper the prosecution.\"In the Law Lexicon, (3rd reprint - Second Edition) of Sri.P.Ramanatha Aiyer, compounding is defined as follows:\"Compounding felony or offence:-- Compounding an offence is defined to be \"the offence of taking a reward for forbearing to prosecute a felony; as where the party robbed takes his goods again, or other amends upon an agreement not to prosecute.\" (Bunill.) See Criminal Procedure Code as to compoundable and non-compoundable offences.\"Offences which are not mentioned in Table of Sub-ss.1 or 2 of S.320 cannot be compounded and such compounding cannot be accepted by the court, though a compromise between the victim and accused may persuade the court to take a lenient view in the matter of sentence (See Bankat & Anr. v. State of Maharashtra (2005 (1) KLT SN 272005 (1) KLT 27 (C.No. 28) SC = (2005) 1 SCC 343)2005 (1) SCC 3432004 ILO SC 1016.7. In a compromise, consensus between the parties to give and take is more important and in a compounding, decision of the victim of offence not to prosecute and not to continue with prosecution is more important. But a mere decision not to prosecute the complaint and non filing of a criminal complaint by victim cannot be taken as compounding of the offence, even if such decision is taken on the basis of a compromise between the parties. Now offence under S.324 Indian Penal Code, 1860 is non compoundable. If a victim of that offence refuses to file a complaint we cannot say that the offence is compoundable. But compounding cannot be equivalent to mere non prosecution of complaint and, in any event, once a person is convicted, compounding has to be permitted by the Appellate Court or revisional court, as the case may be, to have the effect of an acquittal of the accused. A criminal case instituted on the terms of private complaint may result in acquittal of the case if complainant party is not adducing any evidence, but that is different from compounding an offence. In this case, crime was registered, trial was conducted and petitioner accused was convicted by the Trial Court. Conviction was confirmed by the Appellate Court and revisional court and the conviction became final. Then the real question before us is that after confirmation of conviction, whether compounding of the offence can be accepted and whether court can review the conviction on the basis of subsequent compromise and joint petition for compounding the offence ? If it cannot be done after the disposal of the revision petition, can the same result be obtained by filing a petition under S.482 of Cr.P.C. or under Art.227 of the Constitution Of India, 1950 ?8. For answering the reference and for deciding the matter, we are bound to consider several points.(1) Whether before insertion of S. 147 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, offence under S. 138 was compoundable? It was pointed out by the petitioner that in M.Mohan Reddy v. Jairaj D. Bhale Rao & Ors. (1996 (1) KLT SN381996 (1) KLT 38 (C.No.50) AP= 1996 Crl.L.J. 1010)1996 CrLJ 1010 (Andhra Pradesh High Court) and Naimesh P. Pandya v. State (1998 Crl.L.J. 4424)1998 CrLJ 4424 (Gujarat High Court) courts allowed compounding of the offence under S.138 of N.I.Act before insertion of S.147. The Karnataka High Court in M.Rangaswamaiah v. R. Shettappa (2002 Crl.L.J. 4792)2002 CrLJ 4792 held that in the absence of any prohibition in the Act or Cr.P.C, offence under S. 138 can be compounded. Court relied on the decision of the Apex Court in O.P.Dholakia v. State of Haryana ((2000) 1 SCC 762)2000 (1) SCC 7621999 ILO SC 825. But in that case it was not held by the Apex Court that offence under S. 138 is compoundable, although the court accepted the compromise on the facts of the case by exercising powers of the Supreme Court, without creating a precedent. The above judgment is only a short judgment and concluding paragraph is as follows:\"3. Mr.Mahabir Singh, the learned counsel appearing for the State of Haryana however contends that the conviction and sentence having been upheld by all the three forums, this Court need not interfere with the same and it was open for the parties to enter into a compromise at an earlier stage, when the appeal was pending. Now this Court need not show any indulgence. There is some force in the aforesaid contention. But taking into consideration the nature of offence in question and the fact that the complainant and the accused have already entered into a compromise, we think it appropriate to grant permission, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case, to compound. Necessarily the conviction and sentence under S.138 of the Act stands annulled. The special leave petition is disposed of accordingly.\"It shows that it is a special order passed under the powers of the Supreme Court on the facts of that case and it will not be a binding precedent for the question that an offence can be permitted to be compounded even if it is not compoundable. As held by the Apex Court in Indian Bank v. ABS Marine Products Pvt. Ltd. (2006 (2) KLT 5382006 (2) KLT 538 (SC) = 2006 AIR SCW 2156)2006 AIR(SCW) 2156 relief given on special facts, exercising power under Art.142 is not a precedent.9. Ss. 4 and 5 of the Cr.P.C. reads as follows:\"S.4. Trial of offences under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and other laws:-(1) All offences under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (45 of 1860) shall be investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions hereinafter contained.(2) All offences under any other law shall be investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to the same provisions, but subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or place of investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with such offences.S.5. Saving:- Nothing contained in this Code shall, in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary, affect any special or local law for the time being in force, or any special jurisdiction or power conferred, or any special form of procedure prescribed, by any other law for the time being in force.\"Areading of Ss. 4 and 5 of Cr.P.C. shows that for enquiry, investigation and trial of the offence, whether under Indian Penal Code, 1860 or any other Special Act, procedure under Cr.P.C. has to be followed unless Special Act provides procedure. Offence is defined under S.2(n) which is as follows:S.2(n): \"offence\" means any act-or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force and includes any act in respect of which a complaint may be made under S.20 of the Cattle-trespass Act, 1871 (1 of 1871);Admittedly for the trial of the offence under S. 138 except certain specific deviations made under Ss. 140, 142 and 143 of the N.1. Act, the Criminal Procedure Code has to be followed. The complaint, appeal and revision petition are filed under the provisions of the Cr.P.C. Sub-s.(9) of S.320 of Cr.P.C. provides a specific bar to compound any offence except as provided by this Section. Therefore, not only Indian Penal Code, 1860 offence, any offence under Special Act also cannot be compounded except as specifically provided under S.320. Hence before insertion of S. 147 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, offence under S. 138 was not compoundable. A Division Bench of this Court in Antony v. Sherafudin (1995 (2) KLT 386)1995 (2) KLT 386 considered the provisions of N.I.Act and S.320 of Cr.P.C. observed as follows:\"As there is specific provision in the Criminal Procedure Code for compounding offences enumerated in the tables under Ss.320 (1) and (2) and as sub-s.(9) makes the position crystal clear, that no offence shall be compounded except as provided in the Section, any offence coming under a special enactment cannot be compounded under the provisions of the Code. In a case where a special enactment provides for compobinding of offences it can certainly be done, if not, it cannot be done. S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 does not provide for compounding of the offence. So long as there is no specific provision for compounding of the offence under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the offence cannot be compounded by invoking S.320 Cr.P.C.\"We respectfully follow the above judgment, disagree with the view expressed in the decisions mentioned above, that even before S. 147 was inserted in the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, offence under that Act was compoundable. In fact only because offences under N.I.Act are not compoundable without a specific clause in the special enactment, S. 147 was enacted by the Parliament.10. Whether offences under N.I.Act committed prior to the insertion of S.147 of N.I.Act were compoundable ? Since bar under S.320 of Cr.P.C. is lifted by insertion of S. 147 with respect of offences under the N.I.Act, it can be considered applicable to all pending proceedings. No new penalties are prescribed. In such cases pending cases are governed by the amended provisions. None of the rights of the parties are taken away, but it confers additional rights to the parties and no prejudice is caused. The provi sions incorporated by amendment has to be construed from the points of view of the mischief the new provisions seeks to remedy and the manner in which it is to be remedied (See Ajith Kumar v. State (1961 (2) Crl.L.J. 617)1961 (2) CrLJ 617 (Cal. F.B.). But if right of compounding is taken away it may be possible to argue that since prejudice is caused, amendment shall be prospective. We are not considering that aspect here. But here no prejudice is caused by making S. 147 applicable to pending proceedings. It will not affect concluded matters but all pending cases under S. 138 can be compounded especially considering the objects of the Act. In this connection we refer to the observations of the Honourable Supreme Court in Dhannalal v.D.P. Vijayvargiya & Ors. (1996 (2) KLT 2831996 (2) KLT 283 (SC) = (1996) 4 SCC 652)1996 (4) SCC 6521996 ILO SC 3588 and New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. C.Padma & Anr. (2004 (1) KLT SN 202004 (1) KLT 20 (C.No.26) SC = AIR 2003 SC 4394)2003 AIR(SC) 43942003 ILO SC 737 with regard to issue regarding deletion of S.166(3) of the Act prescribing limitations of filing claim petitions under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Hon'ble Apex Court found that the benefit of amendment is applicable to all pending cases. In Dhannalal's case (supra) it was held as follows:\"From the amending Act it does not appear that the said sub-s.(3) has been deleted retrospectively. But at the same time, there is nothing in the amending Act to show that benefit of deletion of sub-s.(3) of S. 166 is not to be extended to pending claim petitions where a plea of limitation has been raised. The effect of deletion of sub-s.(3) from S.166 of the Act can be tested by an illustration. Suppose an accident has taken place two years before 14.11.1994 when sub-s, (3) was omitted from S. 166. For one reason or the other no claim petition had been filed by the victim or the heirs of the victim till 14.11.1994. Can a claim petition be not filed after 14.11.1994 in respect of such accident? Whether a claim petition filed after 14.11.1994 can be rejected by the Tribunal on the ground of limitation saying that the period of twelve months which had been prescribed when sub-s.(3) of S.166 was in force having expired, the right to prefer the claim petition had been extinguished and shall not be revived after deletion of sub-s.(3) of S. 166 with effect from 14.11.1994? According to us, the answer should be negative.\"It was also held that benefit of the above provision is applicable to all pending cases before the Tribunal or the High Court or the Supreme Court. But in para. 8 it was held as follows:\"8. The matter will be different if any claimant having filed a petition for claim beyond time which has been rejected by the Tribunal or the High Court, the claimant does not challenge the same and allows the said judicial order to become final. The aforesaid amending Act shall be of no help to such claimant.\"Offences punishable under Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 are made compoundable by insertion of S. 147 by the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment And Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002. It is a beneficial provision and it is applicable for all cases pending trial, appeal and revision even if the offence is committed before the amendment. But is not applicable to concluded matters.11. What is the effect of non obstante clause in S.147 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and whether the court has to ignore entire Cr.P.C. including S.320 while dealing with a compounding petition ? It is true that S.147 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 starts with the non obstante clause \"not withstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973\". Such clauses are added with a view to give an overriding effect over the provision or Act mentioned in the non obstante clause in case of conflict, the provision or Act mentioned in the non obstante clause, the enactment following it will have its full operation or that the provisions embraced in the non obstante clause will not be an impediment for the operation of the Section (See South India Corporation (P) Ltd. v. Secretary, Board of Revenue, Trivandrum & Mr. AIR 1964 SC 207))1964 AIR(SC) 2071963 ILO SC 357 (KB.) = (1961 KLT 7821961 KLT 782. A non obstante clause may be used as a legislative device to modify the ambit of the provision or law mentioned in the non obstante clause or to override it in specified circumstances (See Pannalal Bansilal Patil & Ors. v. State of Andhra Pradesh & Arm (AIR 1996 SC 1023)1996 AIR(SC) 10231996 ILO SC 3084. In A. G. Varadarajulu v. State of Tamil Nadu (AIR 1998 SC 1388))1998 AIR(SC) 13881998 ILO SC 2169, Apex Court held that even though the notwithstanding clause is very widely worded, its scope may be restricted by construction having regard to the intention of the Legislature gathered from the enacting clause or other related provisions in the Act. This may be particularly so when the notwithstanding clause \"does not refer to any particular provision which it intends to override but refers to the provisions of the statute generally.\" Thus the notwithstanding clause in S.21A of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 which reads 'notwithstanding anything contai ned in S .22 or in any other provision of this Act and in any other law for the time being in force' was construed not to override the definition of 'stridhana land' in S.3(42). In I.C.LC.I. Bank Ltd. v. SIDCO Leather Ltd. & Ors. (2006 AIR SCW 2361)2006 AIR(SCW) 2361 it was held as follows:38. The non-obstante nature of a provision although may be of wide amplitude, the interpretative process thereof must be kept confined to the legislative policy. Only because the dues of the workmen and the debt due to the secured creditors are treated pari passu with each other, the same by itself, in our considered view, would not lead to the conclusion that the concept of inter se priorities amongst the secured creditors had thereby been intended to be given a total go-by.39. A non obstante clause must be given effect to, to the extent the Parliament intended and not beyond the same.\"But non obstante clause can have a wide meaning also considering the object of certain legislations as held in V.C.Shukla v. State through C.B.I. (AIR 1980 SC 962)1980 AIR(SC) 9621979 ILO SC 331. Therefore 'non obstante clause' has to be considered in the circumstances of each case. We have already seen that offences punishable under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 were not compoundable before S. 147 was inserted in the year 2000. S. 147 only provides that notwithstanding the provisions of Cr.P.C. against compounding of the offences other than those specifically mentioned in S.320 (1) and (2), offences under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 can also be compounded. The words 'not withstanding the provisions of the Cr.P.C.' only means notwithstanding the prohibition against compounding the offences other than coming under Tables annexed to Ss.320 (1) and (2), offences under N.I.Act also can be compounded. But the non obstante clause mentioned in the beginning of the Section will not completely exclude application of Cr.P.C. to offences under the N.I.Act. In this context, we refer to the decision of the Supreme Court in Parayankandiyal Eravath Kanapravan Kalliani Amma (Smt) & Ors. v. K.Devi & Ors. (1996 (2) KLT 421996 (2) KLT 42 (SC) = (1996) 4 SCC 76)1996 (4) SCC 761996 ILO SC 2858 wherein meaning of such clause are explained as follows:\"It is equivalent to saying that in spite of the provision or Act mentioned in the nun obstante clause, the enactment following it will have its full operation or that the provision indicated in the non obstante clause will not be an impediment for the operation of the enactment.\"12. If S.320 is completely not applicable, there is no procedure prescribed for acceptance of the compounding by the Court resulting in acquittal of the accused at the stage of trial or appeal or in revision either under Cr.P.C. or N.I.Act. If S .320 is not applicable and entire S.320 is excluded even if parties have compounded, it will not have the effect of acquittal as provided under S.320 and if he is convicted and sentenced, he has to undergo sentence on the basis of the conviction entered notwithstanding the subsequent compounding or compromising of the offence. The learned Judge in Sabu George's case (supra) at paragraph 10 held as follows:\"When no special procedure is prescribed under any special law, the procedure prescribed under the Cr.P.C. has to be followed for investigation, enquiry, trial or otherwise dealing with such situations. If there is a specific provision contra in any such special law, the provisions of the Code shall not apply. About the procedure for composition and its consequences we have stipulations in the Code. There is no provision in the N.I.Act also. Therefore, S.4 of the Cr.P.C. must apply and S.5 cannot apply while considering the procedure to be followed for effecting a composition of the offence under S.138 of the N.I.Act as permitted under S. 147 of the N.I.Act. Any different understanding of the non obstante clause in S.147 will leave the courts without any known or specified procedure to be followed while considering the acceptance of the composition. The mm obstante clause in S.147 means only this, i.e.,\"an offence under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 may not be compoundable under S.320 of the Code. That provision as it stands may apply only to specified offences under the Indian Penal Code, 1860. But it is stipulated hereby that the offence under S.138 shall also be reckoned as a compoundable offence under the Code i.e. under S.320 Cr.P.C.\"We agree with the learned Single Judge in that aspect and hold that procedure under S.320 of Cr.P.C. should be followed while compounding an offence under N.I.Act not withstanding the non obstante clause in S. 147 and the above clause only removes the prohibition in Cr.P.C. against compounding offences not mentioned in the tables in S.320 (1) and (2).13. Next question is whether permission from the court is required to compound the offence under N.I.Act ? Table in sub-s.(l) of S.320 describes offences which can be compounded without permission from the court. Table annexed to sub-s.(2) describes offences which can be compounded only with the permission of the Court. There is no indication in the N.I.Act, that to avail the benefits of S. 147, permission from the Court is necessary to compound the case. Therefore offence under the N.I.Act can be compounded in par with the offences mentioned in Table I in S.320 (1) without permission from the court. Hence to that effect we fully endorse the above view of the learned Single Judge in Sabu George's case (supra).14. Can the offence under Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 or offence punishable under Table I of S.320 be compounded after conviction, when the appeal or revision is pending ? We have already seen that offence under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 comes in par with offences mentioned in the Table I of S.320(1). Such offence is compoundable when the trial is pending, without permission from court. Therefore if such offences are compounded by the parties, the Trial Court is bound to accept the compounding. The Trial Court need only look into whether a genuine compromise was entered into and the compounding petition is filed accordingly. The resultant consequence is the effect of an acquittal of the accused. Sub-s.(8) of S.320 provides that the compounding of the offence under this section shall have the effect of an acquittal of the accused. It is not equivalent to discharge but acquittal and for the same offence, he cannot be again prosecuted in view of S.300 of Cr.P.C. and Art.20(2) of the Constitution Of India, 1950. If the parties have compounded the offence, before the court taking cognizance, court can consider the same and if the offence alleged is compoundable under S.320, the F.I.R. or complaint, as the case may be, can be quashed as a fit case in a petition under S.482, if the court is satisfied that the offence was compounded. Hence offences can be compounded even before taking cognizance of the offence by'the Magistrate and we are in full agreement with the observations of the learned Single Judge in para.13, which is reproduced below:13. If the offence is compoundable under S.320(l) and the parties have compounded the offence, the police must be bound to accept the same and drop further action and make report of the same to the Magistrate concerned. If the police do not, it must be possible for the parties to approach the learned Magistrate or this Court under S.482 Cr.P.C. I therefore agree that composition of an offence under S.320(l) can be effected even before cognizance of the offence is taken by the Magistrate.But there is no provision for compounding the offence after conviction without permission of or intervention from the court, whether the offence is compoundable, with or without permission as classified under Table I or Table II. This is because the compounding will have the effect of an acquittal and setting aside of conviction. Conviction, in the absence of appeal or revision, becomes a concluded matter. Sub- cl. 5 and 6 of S.320 allows the compounding of offence after conviction, if appeal or revision is pending by the permission of the Appellate Court or Revisional Court as the case may be. If the case is committed for trial also, leave of the committal court is necessary for compounding.15. Once High Court confirms the conviction in revision, it cannot be interfered with by the High Court in view of the subsequent compounding out of court. There is no provision under S.320 or any in the N.l.Act enabling the court to accept or permit the compounding after conviction has become final and no appeal or revision is pending against the conviction. In P.Damodaran & Ors.v. State (1993 Crl.L.J. 404)1993 CrLJ 404 this Court held as follows:\"3. The question that arises for consideration is as to whether compounding of offences could be done when conviction and sentence against the accused have become final. Admittedly the conviction and sentence entered against the accused have become final in view of the dismissal of Crl.R.694 of 1991. As the conviction and sentence entered against the accused have become final, this Court cannot have any jurisdiction to compound the offences even if both parties to the dispute agree for such a course of action.\"\"5. Compounding of offences can be done when the case is pending before the Trial Court or the Appellate Court or the Revisional Court. S.320 (5) provides that when an accused has been convicted and an appeal is pending no composition of the offence shall be allowed without the leave of the Court before which the appeal is to be heard. S.320 (6) enables compounding of offences even during the revisional stage.\"Finally it was held as follows:\"Though compounding of offences can be done during the pendency of the revision before the High Court, it cannot be done at any time after the revision petition has been disposed of. S.320 (6) states that the High Court or Court of Session acting in the exercise of its powers of revision under S.401 may allow any person to compound any offence. This would clearly indicate that after disposal of the Criminal Revision Petition the Court becomes function officio (sic. functus. officio) to allow the request of the parties for compounding of the offences.\"16. S.362 of Cr.P.C. prohibits the court after it has signed its judgment and final order is passed from altering or reviewing the same except to correct a clerical or arithmetical error. In Tanveer Aquil v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. (1990 (Supp) SCC 63)1990 (S) SCC 631989 ILO SC 361 considered the issue. In that case, in appeal, court confirmed the conviction. After judgment was pronounced, parties compromised the matter and tiled a petition to compound the matter. It was dismissed as High Court cannot entertain such a petition in view of the bar under S.362. Apex Court confirmed the same as once judgment is pronounced, High Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an application for grant of permission to compound the offence. In such case proper case is to file appeal or S.L.P. as the case may be and get necessary relief from the Supreme Court. In State of Kerala v. MM. Manikantan Nair (2001 (3) KLT 802001 (3) KLT 802001 ILO SC 20155 (SC) = AIR 2001 SC 2145)2001 AIR(SC) 21452001 ILO SC 20155 Apex Court observed as follows:The Code of Criminal Procedure does not authorise the High Court to review its Judgment or Order passed either in exercise of its appellate, revisional or original jurisdiction. S.362 of the Code prohibits the court after it has signed its Judgment or Order except to correct a clerical or arithmetical error. This prohibition is complete and no criminal court can review its own judgment or order after it is signed. By the first Order, dated 31st May, 2000, the High Court rejected the prayer of the respondent for quashing the criminal proceeding. This order attained its finality. By the impugned Order, the High Court reversed its earlier Order and quashed the criminal proceeding for want of proper sanction. By no stretch of imagination, it can be said that by the impugned order, the High Court only corrected any clerical or arithmetical error. In fact the impugned Order is an Order of review, as the earlier Order was reversed, which could not have been done as there is no such provision under the Code of Criminal Procedure, but there is an interdict against it.This Court in Hari Singh Mann v. Harbhajan Singh Bajwa & Ors. (2000 (3) KLT 9352000 (3) KLT 9352000 ILO SC 2803 (SC) = (2001) 1 SCC 169)2001 (1) SCC 1692000 ILO SC 2803, held that S.362 of the Criminal Procedure Code mandates that no Court, when it has signed its Judgment or final Order disposing of a case shall alter or review the same except to correct a clerical or an arithmetical error and that this section is based on an acknowledged principle of law that once a matter is finally disposed of by a Court, the said court in the absence of a specific statutory provision becomes functus officio and disentitled to entertain a fresh prayer for the same relief unless the former order of final disposal is set aside by the Court of competent jurisdiction.\"Once the order of conviction is confirmed in revision, the Revisional Court cannot review or alter the conviction in view of the specific bar under S.362. The above statutory bar of review cannot be over-reached by filing clarification petition, modification petition or a petition under S.482 or by resorting to any other innovative methods. Mandate of S.362 has to be obeyed in letter and spirit.17. Can the High Court reverse, alter or modify the conviction which became final by its own order passed in a revision petition, by using power under S.482 of the Cr.P.C. which ultimately may amount to cancellation of conviction and sentence taking note of subsequent events like compounding of the case ? We are of the opinion that inherent powers cannot be used to defeat the specific procedure prescribed in Cr.P.C. It is not a device to over come the specific bar under S.362. After analysing various case laws also. Apex Court in Central Bureau of Investigation v. Ravi Shankar Srivastava. I.A.S. & Arr. (2006 AIR SCW 3990)2006 AIR(SCW) 3990, defined powers of the High Court under S. 482 as follows:\"Exercise of power under S.482 of the Code in a case of this nature is the exception and not the rule. The section does not confer any new powers on the High Court. It only saves the inherent power which the Court possessed before the enactment of the Code. It envisages three circumstances under which the inherent jurisdiction may be exercised, namely, (i) to give effect to an order under the Code, (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of court, and (iii) to otherwise secure the ends of justice. It is neither possible nor desirable to lay down any inflexible rule which would govern the exercise of inherent jurisdiction. No legislative enactment dealing with procedure can provide for all cases that may possibly arise. Courts, therefore, have inherent powers apart from express provisions of law which are necessary for proper discharge of functions and duties imposed upon them by law. That is the doctrine which finds expression in the section which merely recognizes and' preserves inherent powers of the High Courts. All courts, whether civil or criminal possess, in the absence of any express provision, as inherent in their Constitution Of India, 1950, all such powers as are necessary to do the right and to undo a wrong in course of administration of justice on the principle \"quando lex aliquid alicui concedit, concedere videturet id sine quo res ipsae esse non potest\" (when the law gives a person anything it gives him that without which it cannot exist). While exercising powers under the section, the court does not function as a court of appeal or revision. Inherent jurisdiction under the section though wide has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution and only when such exercise is justified by the tests specifically laid down in the section itself, it is to be exercised ex debito justitiae to do real and substantial justice for the administration of which alone courts exist.\"The learned Judge in Sabu George's case (supra) relied on an observation of the Supreme Court in Mostt. Simrikhia v. Smt.Dolley Mukherjee alias Chhahi Mukherjee & Anr. (1990 (2) KLT SN 221990 (2) KLT 22 (C.No.32) SC = 1990 Crl.L.J. 1599)1990 CrLJ 1599 for holding that S.482 can be used to review the effect of an order if there is change in circumstances. Facts of that case are described in para.1 of the above Apex Court judgment as follows:\"In a case instituted on a private complaint by the appellant for offences under Ss.452 and 323, Indian Penal Code, 1860, the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Patna, in exercise of power under S. 192(2), Cr.P.C. transferred the case for enquiry under S.202 of the Code. The Court of the Second Class Magistrate, after examining witnesses, by order dated 22.3.1985 issued process to the two accused, the respondents herein. The order of the Magistrate issuing process was challenged by the respondents under S.482 before the High Court. The main ground urged before the High Court was that the First Class Magistrate had transferred the case without taking cognizance of the offence and the subsequent proceedings were, therefore, illegal. The High Court, by its order dated 20.8.1988, dismissed the petition. It was found that there was no such illegality. The respondents again made Crl.Misc.Petition No.2314/89 under S.482, Cr.P.C. before the High Court alleging, inter alia, that the record of the proceedings on close scrutiny would indicate that the case had not been taken cognizance of before the transfer. The learned Single Judge accepted the case of the respondents and quashed the proceedings by the impugned order.\"The Apex Court considered the powers under Ss.482 and 362 and observed as follows:\"The inherent power under S.482 is intended to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court and to secure ends of justice. Such power cannot be exercised to do something which is expressly barred under the Code. If any consideration of the facts bv way of review is not permissible under the Code and is expressly barred, it is not for the Court to exercise its inherent power to reconsider the matter and record a conflicting decision.\"Therefore it was further observed as follows:\"If there had been change in the circumstances of the case, it would be in order for the High Court to exercise its inherent powers in the prevailing circumstances and pass appropriate orders to secure the ends of justice or to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court. Where there is no such changed circumstances and the decision has to be arrived at on the facts that existed as on the date of the earlier order, the exercise of the power to reconsider the same materials to arrive at different conclusion is in effect a review, which is expressly barred under S.362.\"It is also observed as follows:\"If a matter is covered by an express letter of law, the court cannot give a go-by to the statutory provisions and instead evolve a new provision in the garb of inherent jurisdiction\"Finally after discussions and verdict and ratio decidendi of the case is stated in para. 6 of the judgment which is as follows:\"6. The inherent jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be invoked to override bar of review under S.362. It is clearly stated in Sooraj Devi v.Pyare Lal (1981 KLT SN 211981 KLT 21 (C. No.38) SC :(1981) 1 SCC 5001981 (1) SCC 5001981 ILO SC 135 : (1981 Crl.L.J. 296)1981 CrLJ 296 that the inherent power of the Court cannot be exercised for doing that which is specifically prohibited by the Code. The law is therefore clear that the inherent power cannot be exercised for doing that which cannot be done on account of the bar under other provisions of the Code. The Court is not empowered to review its own decision under the purported exercise of inherent power. We find that the impugned order in this case is in effect one reviewing the earlier order on a reconsideration of the same materials. The High Court has grievously erred in doing so. Even on merits, we do not find any compelling reasons to quash the proceedings at that stage.\"With the above findings, appeal was allowed setting aside the order of the High Court. With great respect, we are of the opinion that a sentence in a judgment cannot be taken out from the context and used for laying down the preposition that if there is change in circumstances, by using inherent powers under S.482 express bar under S.362 can be got over. Learned Single Judge in Sabu George's case (supra) was of the opinion that the above observations of the Supreme Court enable the High Court in effect, to set aside the conviction which is confirmed by its own order, taking note of subsequent compounding of the offence and at para. 26 it was observed as follows:26. In the instant cases when the revision petition was disposed of by this Court, this circumstance - that the parties settled the dispute and the complainant compounded the offence - was not there at all. It is a subsequent change in circumstance. The decision in Mostt.Simrikhia (supra) squarely applies. That was a case where an earlier application under S.482 Cr.P.C. was dismissed, but still the Supreme Court held that a change in circumstances is sufficient to justify the invocation of the powers afresh under S.482 Cr.P.C. notwithstanding the bar under S.362 Cr.P.C In the instant case, the powers under S.482 Cr.P.C. have not been sought to be invoked earlier. Only the revisional powers were exercised. That is all the more the reason why under the changed circumstances the extra ordinary inherent jurisdiction under S.482 Cr.P.C. can be invoked. In the light of the dictum in Mostt.Simrikhia, earlier decisions rendered and subsequent decisions, which do not refer to the said decision specifically and in which the opinion is expressed that the powers under S.482 Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked after disposal of the revision in view of the bar under S.362, cannot be held to lay down the law correctly.\"We are unable to accept the above view expressed in Sabu George's case, as in our opinion, no such conclusion can be made on relying on the decision of the Apex Court in Mostt.Simrikhia's case (supra).18. It is true that in Kirpal Pratapsingh Ori v. Balvinder Kaur Hardipsingh Lobana & Anr. (2004 Crl.L.J. 3786)2004 CrLJ 3786 a learned Single judge of Gujarat High Court also held that even after dismissal of revision petition, inherent powers under S.482 can be used for accepting compromise between the parties since Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is a special law and S.320 is not applicable. Very same learned Single Judge who decided Kirpalsingh 's case (supra) took a slightly different view in Rameshbhai Somabhai Patel v. Dineshbhai Achalanand Rathi and another (2005 Crl.L.J. 431)2005 CrLJ 431. In that case at para. 10, it was held that offences under N.I.Act can be considered compoundable like offences in Table 1 of S.320 without prior permission and compounding can be accepted in a revision petition by the court and revision petitioner can be acquitted. Relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in State of Orissa v. Ram ChanderAgrawal (AIR 1979 SC 87)1979 AIR(SC) 871978 ILO SC 278, Allahabad High Court in Chhntey Singh v. State of U.P. (1980 Crl.L.J. 583)1980 CrLJ 583 held that an application for compounding the offence must be made in a pending proceeding. Therefore, an application for compounding offence filed after the conviction has become final, cannot be entertained. Once the appeal or revision has been finally disposed of by the High Court, there remains nothing pending. Further, if such an application is allowed, it will result in setting aside the judgment of the High Court. It cannot be done in view of express bar under S.362, which permits correction in the judgment in respect of clerical or arithmetical errors only. In Moti Lal v. State of M.P. (AIR 1994 SC 1544)1994 AIR(SC) 15441993 ILO SC 116, Apex Court considered a similar matter. In that case 15 accused were punished for various offences under Ss. 302, 325 etc. read with S.149 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. Three persons were convicted. In appeal High Court acquitted two persons and remaining accused were convicted under S.304 Part I of Indian Penal Code, 1860 without the aid of S.149 or S.34. Later an application was filed before the High Court under S.482, Cr.P.C. with the prayer that the conviction under S.304 Part I, Indian Penal Code, 1860 was patently wrong since the injury said to have been caused by the appellant was not serious and necessarily not fatal. The High Court exercising jurisdiction under S.482, Cr.P.C. accepted the plea and altered the conviction to S.324, Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced the appellant to 3 years' R.I. and to pay a fine of Rs.1 , 000/- in default of payment of which to undergo Rl for four months. Not being satisfied with that, the appellant preferred as Special Leave Petition to the Supreme Court along with a prayer seeking permission to get the offence compounded. Apex Court found that High Court erred in altering the conviction exercising jurisdiction under S.482 and held as follows:\"2. S.362, Cr.P.C. in clear terms lays down that the Court cannot alter judgment after the same has been signed except to correct clerical or arithmetical errors. That being the position the High Court had no jurisdiction under S.482, Cr.P.C. to alter the earlier judgment.\"Thereafter appeal from the main judgment was considered on merits and conviction under S.304 Part I was altered to conviction under S.326 and sentence was reduced. S.482 also cannot be invoked against the clear mandate of Ss.320 and 362. We are of the view that decision of the Apex Court in Mohd. Yaseen v. State of U.P. ((2007) 7 SCC 49)2007 (7) SCC 49 provides a complete answer to the question. In that case Hon'ble Supreme Court was considering two connected appeals. The appellant was convicted for an offence punishable under Ss.7 and 16 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. The learned Judicial Magistrate (Economic Offences), Bareilly, found the accused guilty and convicted him and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year and to pay a fine of Rs.2.000/- with default stipulation. Conviction and sentence were confirmed in appeal. When revision petition was posted for hearing, the advocate who was appearing in the case reported 'no instructions'. Thereafter court considered the matter on merit and Revision Petition was dismissed. After Revision Petition was dismissed, a petition was filed under S.482 to recall the order. It was submitted that name of the advocate of the petitioner was not printed in the cause list and also submitted that he produced a certificate before the Appellate Court that his age was below 18 years and hence he is entitled to benefit of S .20 AA of the Food Adulteration Act and since this was not considered at all when the matter was disposed of without hearing the advocate and hence in the interest of justice and to avoid multiplicity of the case, matter shall be reconsidered in a petition under S.482. The High Court rejected the appeal in view of special bar under S.362. Apex Court agreed with the above view as order in criminal revision cannot be reviewed or altered in a petition under S .482 though it will have avoided multiplicity of proceedings. Apex Court held as follows:\"In State of Orissa v. Ram Chancier Aganwala ((1979) 2 SCC 3051979 (2) SCC 3051978 ILO SC 278 at page 315) it was noted in para 20 as follows:\"This decision instead of supporting the respondent clearly lays down, following U.J.S. Chopra v. State of Bombay (AIR 1955 SG 633)1955 AIR(Sc) 6331955 ILO SC 13 that once a judgment has been pronounced by a High Court either in exercise of its appellate or its revisional jurisdiction, no review or revision can be entertained against that judgment as there is no provision in the Criminal Procedure Code which would enable the High Court to review the same or to exercise revisional jurisdiction..........The provisions of S.561-A of the Code cannot be invoked for exercise of a power which is specifically prohibited by the Code.\"In Hari Singh Mann v. Harbhajan Singh Bajwa ((2001) 1 SCC 1692001 (1) SCC 1692000 ILO SC 2803 at page 175) the position was reiterated in para. 10 as follows:\"10. S.362 of the Code mandates that no court, when it has signed its judgment or final order disposing of a case shall alter or review the same except to correct a clerical or an arithmetical error. The section is based on an acknowledged principle of law that once a matter is finally disposed of by a court, the said court in the absence of a specific statutory provision becomes functus officio and disentitled to entertain a fresh prayer for the same relief unless the former order of final disposal is set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction in a manner prescribed by law. The court becomes functus officio the moment the official order disposing of a case is signed. Such an order cannot be altered except to the extent of correcting a clerical or an arithmetical error.\"Therefore, the High Court rightly observed that the application under S.482 of the Code is to be dismissed.\"After dismissing the appeal filed against order, dismissing petition was filed under S.482 by the High Court. But the Apex Court considered the appeal filed against order passed on merits in revision and allowed the same and remanded the matter to the Trial Court for verifying the documents produced. Therefore here also it is for the parties to move the Supreme Court and submit that they have compromised the case. Only Supreme Court can change the order passed by the High Court in revision.19. After considering S.147 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, Bombay High Court has recently held in Prakash B. Borkar v. Sukhalal Kumar & Anr. (2007 (2) KLJ 9)2007 (2) KLJ 9 that cloak of S.482 of the Cr.P.C. and the practice of filing miscellaneous petitions after disposal of the main case is unwarranted. Inherent powers cannot be used so as to review the judgment and also opined that it is for the parties to approach the Supreme Court. We respectively agree with the above decision. We hold that order passed in the revision which has become final cannot be altered by invoking S.482 even if the matter is subsequently compromised between the parties or complainant wants to withdraw the complaint. By using inherent powers, court cannot violate the written provisions of the Code. If the offence is compounded, virtue of S.320 (8) will amount to acquittal and in view of S.326, conviction confirmed by the High Court in revision cannot be modified by a proceedings under S.482.20. It was submitted that in Sabu George's case, there is another serious error in so far court imposed fine even after the composition was accepted and provided also for default sentence if fine is not paid. We have already quoted paras. 31 to 33 of the above decision in para. 3 of this order. We have already seen that in view of S.320 (8), effect of compounding is that of the acquittal of the accused. Once the compounding is accepted by the court, court cannot impose any sentence. Imposition of fine and ordering imprisonment in default of payment of fine, after acquitting the accused is foreign to criminal law. After acquitting a person he cannot be sentenced either with imprisonment or fine. That is not possible. Inherent jurisdiction cannot be used for sentencing a person by imposing a fine even after acquitting him, bypassing the statutory provisions. Justice can be administered only according to law. Imposition of fine is different from imposition of cost or compensation. We are of the opinion that, once the compounding is permitted, it will have the effect of an acquittal and no further imposition of fine or any type of sentence can be passed in view of S.320 (8).21. The learned Public Prosecutor pointed out that the very same learned Judge subsequently in Abdul Latheefv. Thankamma Micheal & Anr. (2007 (4) KLT 11032007 (4) KLT 11032007 ILO KER 559 = 2007 (4) KHC 269)2007 (4) KHC 269 held that Sabu George's case is not an authority for the proposition that all post-revision compositions can be accepted invoking powers under S.482 Cr.P.C. and explained Sabu George's case as follows:\"'What remains is only the substantive sentence of imprisonment till rising of Court. Sabu George v. Home Secretary (2007 (1) KLT 982)2007 (1) KLT 9822007 ILO KER 30 is not authority for the proposition that all post-revision compositions can be accepted invoking the powers under S.482 Cr.P.C. That was an exceptional case where the accused would have been compelled to undergo incarceration for a long period of time inspite of the settlement.\"We are of the view that even if relief under S.482 is discretionary, judicial discretion cannot be exercised to discriminate between person to person. It must be applicable to all similarly situated persons. Mere delay or inconvenience in approaching Supreme Court is not a ground for invoking jurisdiction under S.482. In view of the above reasons, we overrule the decision of Sabu George's case so long as it holds that S.482 can be invoked for accepting compounding of the offence under Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 after the conviction is confirmed in a revision by the High Court.22. In K.Kandasamy&Anr. v. K.P.M.V.P. Chandrasekharan (2005 AIR SCW 2460)2005 AIR(SCW) 2460 Hon'ble Supreme Court in a pending matter accepted compounding of the offence after confirmation of the same by Revisional Court. In Sailesh Shyatn Parsekar v. Baban Alias Vishwanath S. Godge andAnr. (2005 AIR SCW 3358)2005 AIR(SCW) 3358, Apex Court allowed the compounding of offence under S. 138 of the N.I.Act when first application was filed in the appeal and conviction and sentence passed by the Revisional Court was set aside. This order will not prevent the petitioners to approach the Hon'ble Supreme Court in appropriate proceedings if the offence is compounded, if so advised. Operative part of the revisional order in this case is as follows:\"In the circumstances, the sentence is modified to imprisonment till the rising of the court and to pay a compensation of Rs.25, 000/- vide S.357(3) Cr.P.C. and in default to undergo simple imprisonment for three months. The revision petitioner shall appear before the Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Nadapuram on 24.4.2007 to receive sentence.\"As found in Abdul Latheef's case (supra) the direction in the revisional order is to pay the compensation and not to deposit the compensation. Therefore if the amount is paid to the complainant there is no question of the petitioner undergoing default sentence. In this case as seen from joint petition, entire amount ordered as compensation is paid. The remaining part is only the appearance of the petitioner before the Magistrate Court, and undergo imprisonment till the rising of the court. Since there was the stay of execution of judgment, petitioner is allowed to appear before the Magistrate Court on or before 24.1.2008 to receive the remaining part of the sentence if he chooses to do so. Hence this Criminal M.C. is dismissed with the above observations.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE J. B. KOSHYOn the allegation that the cheque issued by the petitioner for Rs.20, 000/= was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds, first respondent filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 before the trial court. The defence of the accused was that he has not issued the cheque even though it was from his account maintaining for 'Kavitha Printers'. It is also submitted that his brother Phalgunan might have issued the cheque to the proprietor of Shalimar Paper Mart and that was misused by the complainant. Therefore, a definite defence was taken by the revision petitioner before the court. But, the revision petitioner did not adduce any evidence. He did not even examine his brother or disputing the signature file petition to send the cheque for opinion of handwriting expert. In the above circumstances, after considering the evidence of complainant, the court found that the cheque issued by the petitioner was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds. It is also noticed by the trial court that reply notice was not produced. In the appeal proceedings notice was produced, but, that was not accepted by the court. I am of the opinion that even though reply was produced, since the contentions were not proved, there is no purpose in remanding the matter as he had ample opportunity to examine Phalgunan and also opportunity to prove that the signature in the cheque was forged. But, no effort was made by him. Whereas, complainant has asserted that the petitioner has executed the cheque in presence of his household. In the above circumstances, concurrent conviction made by the courts below cannot be interfered. With regard to the sentence, six months imprisonment was imposed by the trial court. In appeal, sentence was reduced to simple imprisonment for two months. First respondent is interested in getting back his money than sending the revision petitioner in prison. Taking all these facts and circumstances, I reduce the sentence to simple imprisonment for three days and a compensation of Rs.25, 000/=. If the compensation amount is realised, Rs.20, 000/= shall be given to the complainant. In default of payment of compensation, petitioner has to suffer imprisonment for two months. Since now Section 138 matter is compoundable, I give two months time to settle the matter. If the matter is compounded and settled between the parties, they can approach this court for recording the settlement. Otherwise, the modified sentence shall be executed by the trial court. This order is certified to the trial court for implementation after two months.The revision petition is disposed of accordingly.Petition disposed of"

KOSHYRevision petitioner was convicted for an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 on the complaint of the first respondent. His allegation was that the petitioner issued a cheque for Rs.1, 25, 000/= for the due discharge of a legally enforceable debt. The above cheque was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds. After complying with the legal formalities, the complaint was filed. The trial court found him guilty and imposed simple imprisonment for six months and Rs.1, 25, 000/= as compensation. The above was modified by the appellate court after confirming the conviction as follows:\"........ In super session of the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate u/s 138 of the N.I. Act, he is sentenced to undergo S.I.for 10 days (ten).d) The appellant is further directed u/s.357 (3) Cr.P.C. to pay an amount of Rs.1, 30, 000/- as compensation and in default of payment to undergo S.I. For a period of three months. Out of the amount, if realised, Rs.1, 27, 000/- shall be paid to the complainant as compensation and Rs.3000/- shall be credited to the State for the loss suffered by it in terms of judicial time and resources spent by it for the resolution of the controversy, between the parties.\"On going through the evidence, I am of the opinion that all the ingredients of Section 138 are satisfied. Issuance of cheque, due execution of the same, compliance of formalities required under Section 138 of the N.I. Act etc. are proved. The presumption under Section 139 of N.I. Act was not completely rebutted by the revision petitioner. Therefore, there is no ground to interfere with the above conviction concurrently entered by the courts below in a revision petition. However, the appellate court has modified the sentence. I see no ground to interfere with the same. However, since Section 138 matter is compoundable, two months' time is granted for compounding the matter. If the matter is compounded and settled, parties can approach this court for recording the same. Subject to that provision, this revision petition is dismissed. This order is certified to the trial court for implementation after two months.Petition dismissed"

KOSHYFirst respondent/complainant approached the Magistrate's Court complaining that the revision petitioner has borrowed Rs.1, 30, 000/= from him. For discharging the liability, the revision petitioner issued a cheque dated 11.4.1997 from the account maintained by her in the South Indian Bank, Chavakkad Branch, but, the cheque was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds and thereby she committed an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Only after completing the legal formalities, he filed the complaint. The first contention raised by the revision petitioner was that she has no account with the bank and, therefore, the cheque was not issued by her. But, that contention was disproved as the Branch Manager of the South Indian Bank, Chavakkad was examined as PW2 and he stated that the revision petitioner was maintaining an account and the cheque was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds. It was further contended that her husband against whom proceedings are pending in the Family Court has manipulated the cheque. But, there was no acceptable evidence to prove that contention. It was for the revision petitioner to prove the same. There was no evidence to show that the signature was manipulated and petitioner was not able to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The Magistrate's Court found her guilty and imposed a sentence of simple imprisonment for six months and to pay Rs.1, 30, 000/= as compensation under Section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 In appeal, the order was modified. Sentence was reduced to imprisonment for 10 days and there was a direction to pay an amount of Rs.1, 35, 000/= as compensation and in default of payment to undergo simple imprisonment for two months. Out of Rs.1, 35, 000/=, Rs.1, 30, 000/= was directed to be paid as compensation to the complainant. I am of the view that on going through the evidence and contentions, the courts below correctly found that the revision petitioner was guilty and there is no perversity or patent illegality so as to interfere with the same in a revision petition. However, considering the fact that the revision petitioner is a woman and complainant is more interested in getting his money than putting the petitioner in prison, I reduce the sentence of imprisonment to three days and to pay Rs.1, 35, 000/= as compensation with a default sentence of simple imprisonment for two months. Since offence is compoundable, I give two months' time from today to compound the offence and if it is settled, a joint petition can be filed before this court within two months. This order is certified to the trial court for implementation after two months.The Crl.R.P. is partly allowed.Order accordingly"

After completing the legal formalities, the complainant approached the Magistrate's Court. The allegations in the petition were proved by examining the complainant and Branch Manager of the Bank. It was proved that the cheque issued by the revision petitioner was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds. All the ingredients of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 are satisfied.

There was a further direction to pay Rs.32, 500/= to the complainant as compensation. The only submission made is that notice was return unclaimed and it was received back only on 15.5.96 and if time is computed, it is premature by one day. It has been held by the Apex Court that, that cannot be a reason for throwing out a complaint. Even if that point is accepted, at the maximum numbering of the complaint can be made after the expiry of time.

Complaint was filed after completing the legal formalities. Apart from the complainant, Bank Manager was also examined to prove that the cheque was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds. Even though it was contended that amount was borrowed in 1991 and a blank cheque was issued and in 1993 the cheque was misused, no defence witness was examined to prove the same and presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 was not rebutted by the petitioner. Therefore, the trial court found him guilty under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and imposed a sentence of simple imprisonment for three months and Rs.5, 00, 000/= as compensation under Section 357 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 In appeal, the sentence was reduced as follows:\"In super session of the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate u/s 138 of the N.I. Act, he is sentenced to undergo S.I. for one month.The appellant is further directed u/s.357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to pay an amount of Rs.5, 05, 000/- as compensation and in default of payment to undergo S.I. for a period of three months. Out of the amount, if realised Rs.5, 00, 000/- shall be paid to the complainant as compensation and Rs.5, 000/= shall be credited to the state for the loss suffered by it in terms of judicial time and resources spent by it for the resolution of the controversy between the parties.\"Considering the execution of the cheque by the petitioner, dishonour of the same for insufficiency of funds and compliance of formalities for filing Section 138 of the N.I. Act, I am of the opinion that no grounds are made out by the revision petitioner to interfere with the conviction passed by the courts below concurrently in the revisional jurisdiction. The revision petitioner has failed to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the N.I. Act also after admitting the signature in the cheque. However, considering the facts and circumstances of the case, even though I am not interfering with the compensation ordered by the courts below, I am reducing the sentence of imprisonment from one month to three days. Other parts of sentence are not interefered.The revision petition is disposed of accordingly. This order is certified to the trial court for due execution.Petition disposed of"

The trial hass already commenced. The matter rests at the stage of S.313 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973, submits the learned counsel. The complainant has not chosen to produce the original cheque. Evidently, the complainant takes the risk, if any, on account of the non-production of the original cheque. The petitioner filed an application to direct the complainant to cause production of the original cheque. The application was opposed. It was contended that the cheque has already been produced in a civil proceedings between the parties. There upon, the learned Magistrate proceeded to pass Annex.C order dismissing the petition to direct the complainant to produce the document. Aggrieved by the said order the petitioner has come before this Court to invoke the powers under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to set aside the order.2. It is for the complainant to prove his case beyond doubt and to the satisfaction of the court. The complainant does not want the original cheque to be produced. When asked to produce the said cheque, he submitted that the cheque is not available with him and he does not want to take any steps to get the cheque produced before court. I would have expected the petitioner to take advantage of the situation and urge, if that be possible, that adverse inference must be drawn against the complainant. If, on the contrary, the petitioner wants the cheque to be produced to prove any part of his case, it is certainly for the petitioner to take necessary steps to get the cheque produced before the Magistrate in accordance with law. Having not done the same, I find absolutely no merit in the prayer to compel the complainant to apply for return of the cheque from the civil court and produce the same before the criminal court. I am of the opinion that powers under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 cannot and need not be invoked against the impugned order.3. I do further note that the impugned order is only an interlocutory order. Law frowns upon attempts to challenge interlocutory orders during the pendency of the proceedings. This policy of law is clearly reflected in the embargo against revisional challenge against interlocutory orders under Section 397(2) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 I am certainly of the opinion that the extra ordinary inherent jurisdiction cannot and need not be invoked against the impugned interlocutory order, the challenge against which is proscribed under Section 397(2) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 19734. This Crl.M.C. is accordingly dismissed.Order accordingly"

The case stands listed for trial to tomorrow i.e.., 28/9/07. The complainant is not present. He is employed abroad. The learned counsel for the petitioner/complainant submits that the complainant was available in India from 11th July 2007 to 18th September, 2007. The complainant had made requests before the learned Magistrate to post the case for trial during the said period. But unfortunately, the learned Magistrate had not accepted the request of the complainant. It is thereafter that the case was posted to 28/9/07 for trial. The complainant is not able to be present. The learned counsel for the petitioner wants this Court to issue a direction to the learned Magistrate to adjourn the case to a date in future so that the complainant can appear and be ready for trial on such next date. The complainant is expected to be in India by March, 2008, it is submitted.2. It is for the petitioner to make such request before the learned Magistrate by making an appropriate application. I have no reason to assume that the learned Magistrate would not consider such request on merits and in accordance with law. No anticipatory direction need be issued by this Court. The complainant's counsel can make an application before the learned Magistrate to apprise the learned Magistrate of all the circumstances. Appropriate orders must be passed by the learned Magistrate. Needless to say, if the order is adverse to the petitioner, appropriate relief can be sought by the petitioner thereafter. No directions appear to be necessary in the matter now by this Court invoking the powers under Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C.3. With the above observations, this Crl.M.C. is dismissed.4. Hand over a copy of this order to the learned counsel for the petitioner.Order accordingly"

In order to relieve the complainant from the partnership business, the accused agreed to give the share of first respondent within three months and a document was also executed and cheque was given on 22.5.1995 drawn on State Bank of India, Puthuvypu branch for Rs35, 000/-. The cheque was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds. Complainant instituted the case after complying with the statutory notice.2. It was proved that all the statutory formalities were complied with. Ext.A1 is the agreement by which it was agreed that the complainant will be relieved of the arrangement on payment of the amount of Rs.32, 000/-. Ext.A2 is the dishonoured cheque. The manager of State Bank of India proved that the above cheque was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds. All the three accused were convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.11, 000/- each and in default to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months each. It is also directed that the fine, if paid, will be given to PW1 as compensation. When Crl. R.P. came up for admission, it was ordered as follows in the stay petition:\"Notice. Sentence is one of fine only. Petitioners are given 45 days' time to remit the fine amount.\"Therefore, on the basis of the order of stay, fine amount has to be remitted within 45 days. The concurrent conviction entered by the trial court as well as the appellate court are based on evidence adduced. There is no perversity of findings so as to interfere in a revision application. Further, fine alone was imposed and, that too, tallying with the cheque dishonoured. Therefore, it cannot be stated that the sentence imposed is also on the higher side. There is no illegality. I see no ground to interfere in the order impugned. The revision application is dismissed.Application dismissed"

KOSHYFirst respondent in this revision petition filed a complaint under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 contending that the cheque given by the revision petitioner for Rs.25, 000/- was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds. Trial court found that the cheque was issued by the revision petitioner in discharge of a legally enforceable debt and it was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds and all the legal formalities were complied with before filing the complaint. The accused was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for one year and to pay a fine of Rs.3, 000/-. There was also a direction that in default, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for a period of three months. On going through the evidence, I am satisfied that the conviction was entered on valid grounds based on evidence and there is no illegality or perversity in the findings of the courts below. Appellate court also confirmed the conviction and sentence. However, with regard to the sentence, the complainant is more interested in money than imprisoning the revision petitioner.In the above circumstances, the sentence is reduced to imprisonment for one week and payment of Rs.25, 000/- as compensation. If Rs.25, 000/- is not paid within two months, he shall further undergo simple imprisonment for six months. On payment of fine, Rs.24, 000/- shall be given to the first respondent/complainant. I also given a further opportunity to the petitioner to settle the matter. If the matter is settled notwithstanding this order, he is allowed to file a petition here for compounding the offence.The criminal revision petition is allowed partly.Petition allowed"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE J. B. KOSHYComplaint was filed by the first respondent against the revision petitioner/accused alleging that the accused borrowed an amount of Rs.1, 80, 000/- from the complainant in different names on various dates from September, 1992 to January, 1993 pledging ornaments. It was later revealed that the ornaments pledged were of spurious gold and the accused made the complainant to believe that the ornaments were gold ornaments. When the complainant was contacted on 19.5.1994, the accused admitted his guilt and agreed to pay Rs.2, 00, 000/- to the complainant which included the principal amount and interest thereon on or before 20.2.1995. To avoid criminal prosecution, accused promised to pay the amount on 15.6.1995 and a cheque was also issued on 15.6.1995 drawn on Dhanalakshmy Bank Ltd., Thrissur. That cheque was dishonoured, on presentation, for insufficiency of funds. The accused contacted the complainant during September, 1996. Thereafter, accused issued another cheque on 10.9.1996 for Rs.2, 00, 000/-. When that cheque was also dishonoured, finally, notice was issued. Even though it was received, no reply notice was given before filing of the complaint. The trial court as well as the appellate court found regarding the pledging of spurious ornaments as well as issuance of earlier cheques and subsequent cheques etc. Thereafter, trial court also found as follows:\"...... However, I have gone through the signature of the accused in Ext.P9 acknowledgment, Ext.D1 letter, bail bond executed by the accused and the summons received by the accused. The vakkalath of the accused executed also has been perused. On going through these documents, I am satisfied that except in Ext.P2, P4 and P1, the accused has put his full signature but the signature seen in Ext.P1, P2 and P4 is only the half signature. However, on going through the style of writing and the nature of the signature put in end on comparing of with it the admitted signature under section 73 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the signature belong to the accused. It was argued by the learned counsel for the complainant that the accused had pledged spurious gold ornaments to borrow money from the complainant and that was the intention to cheat the complainant. Exts.P2 and P4 cheques and Ext.P1 letter was also issued by the accused in his own signature put in a different fashion. The evidence of PW1 would go to show that the signature seen in Ext.P1, P2 and P4 have been put by the accused himself in the presence of PW1. This evidence of PW1 is not controverted by the accused by adducing evidence to show that the signatures seen in Exts.P1, P2 and P4 do not belong to him. He could have produced his own admitted signatures executed prior to the date of Exts.P2 and P4 cheques.\"The trial court also found that subsequent documents executed by the accused were only a deliberate action on the part of the accused in an attempt to escape from a criminal prosecution. The appellant had a case that he filed C.M.P.No.4112 of 1999 for summoning the bank manager to produce specimen signature form in the account. That was rejected as bank rejected the cheque not because of the difference in signature, but, only for insufficiency of funds. Apart from the above, considering the conduct of the petitioner, I am of the view that the trial court was right in finding against the revision petitioner. Appellate court considered the matter in detail and finally held as follows:\"18. The court may not be an expert, but, definitely, I agree with the view of the court below that a comparison of the admitted signatures available in the case file with the disputed signatures in Exts.P1, P2 and P4 conveys eloquently that the signature/mark on Exts.P1, P2 and P4 are affixed by none other than the appellant, who has admittedly, put the admitted signatures available in the case file.\"I am of the view that the conviction of the revision petitioner under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 was fully justified on the basis of the evidence. In any event, findings are not perverse warranting interference from this court.The appellate court modified the sentence. Revision petitioner was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of 15 days and directed to deposit an amount of Rs.2, 25, 000/- as compensation failing which he shall undergo simple imprisonment for a period of three months. Out of the fine amount, it was already directed that Rs.2, 15, 000/- shall be paid to the complainant as compensation under section 357 (3) of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. If the fine is already paid, the amount as mentioned in the appellate order can be withdrawn by the complainant from the court, if it is not already withdrawn.In the circumstances of the case, if the amount is already paid, petitioner need not suffer any further sentence. If the amount is not already paid, I confirm the punishment as imposed by the court.The Crl. R.P. is allowed partly.Order accordingly"

The complaint was filed before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court- I, Harippad. Cognizance was taken. The accused entered appearance. Without any demur against the jurisdiction of the Magistrate, the trial proceeded. When the matter reached at the stage of 313 examination, without any objection from any side, the learned Magistrate felt that the court had no jurisdiction to proceed with the trial in the light of the decisions in Hariharaputra Sharma v.State of Kerala and another [2006(3) K.L.J 875]2006 (3) KLJ 875. The learned Magistrate without any request from any one, directed the return of the complaint to the complainant.2. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the learned Magistrate was not justified in returning the complaint without any objection from any side. It is prayed that directions under Section 482 may be issued to the learned Magistrate to continue with and complete the trial and dispose of the same in accordance with law.3. The learned counsel for the petitioner heavily relies on the observations in Itty Mathew v. Ramani (1998 (1) KLT 851)1998 (1) KLT 851 and submits that in this case also there is no contention even that any failure of justice results on account of the trial already initiated being completed before the learned Magistrate.4. Notice was issued to the respondent- accused. The respondent- accused have also not chosen to appear before the court and support the impugned order. I must in these circumstances assume that the respondent do also not have any objection in the trial continuing before the the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court- I, Harippad. It is not the case that there is want of jurisdiction to deal with the subject matter. It is only a doubt expressed by the Magistrate on the territorial jurisdiction of the learned Magistrate to conduct the trial. The trial has reached at the stage of 313 examination. I am, in these circumstances, satisfied that the learned Magistrate can be directed to complete the trial and pronounce the judgment invoking powers under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 19735. This Crl.M.C is accordingly allowed. The learned Magistrate shall dispose of S.T.No.361/2006 on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE R. BASANT1. The petitioner faces indictment in a prosecution for offences punishable, inter alia, under Sections 406 and 420 Indian Penal Code, 1860. Cognizance has been taken on the basis of the final report submitted by the Police after due investigation. The petitioner had earlier come before this Court with a grievance that his claim for discharge under Section 239 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 has not been considered by the learned Magistrate. That Crl.M.C was disposed of by the order dated 13.12.07 with observations/directions. Later the learned Magistrate considered the plea of discharge under Section 239 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 The learned Magistrate evidently came to the conclusion that the petitioner is not entitled for discharge under Section 239 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and proceeded to frame charges. A copy of which the same is produced as Annexure 10.2. The learned counsel for the petitioner contends that this prosecution is only a retaliation against the prosecution under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, initiated by the petitioner against the de facto complainant . The contention that the petitioner had taken away the blank signed cheque leaf cannot stand at all, as the petitioner is the person entitled to keep possession of the premises and the de facto complainant had no rights over the property. The learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the assertion of the de facto complainant that he was in exclusive possession of the premises cannot stand in the light of the documents produced and the undisputed fact that the petitioner is the registered lessee under the G.C.D.A. In these circumstances it is prayed that powers under Section 482 may be invoked to quash the proceedings against the petitioner .3. Charges have been framed under Section 240 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 Ordinarily and normally I would expect the in dictee if he is aggrieved by the order framing charges to challenge the charge under Section 240 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 by invoking the revisional jurisdiction. The petitioner has no intention to do so. He has come to this Court with a prayer to invoke powers under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner in detail. I have perused the records. To accept the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner, disputed questions of fact will have to be resolved. The question will have to be decided as to the person in whose exclusive possession the premises was on date of the alleged offence. Not withstanding the documents- registered lease deed, it is contended that not the petitioner but the de facto complainant was in physical possession. I am of the opinion that such complex disputed questions of facts cannot be attempted to be resolved in proceedings under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. It is confirmed that the matter has been listed for trial tomorrow that is 27.9.07. I am of opinion that the petitioner must take part in the trial and raise all his contentions. I find no compelling reason to invoke the powers under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to prematurely bring to termination of proceedings initiated against the petitioner.4. This Crl.M.C is, in these circumstances dismissed. Needless to say that this dismissal is solely on the ground that the extra ordinary inherent jurisdiction is found to be not appropriate to be invoked. I have not chosen to express any opinion on the disputed questions. The petitioner's right to raise all his contentions before the trial court shall remain unfettered.Order accordingly"

The case of the complainant is that the accused having copra transaction with the complainant society, an amount of Rs.1, 15, 000/- was due from the accused in connection with the said transaction, for which she issued the impugned cheque putting date 4.8.96. When the cheque was presented for collection, it was returned dishonoured by noting \"funds insufficient\".2. The evidence adduced in the matter consisted of the testimony of PWs 1 and 2 and Exts.P1 to P10.PW1 is the complainant/secretary of the bank. He has testified as to the transaction, of issuance of cheque, dishonour of the same and has also proved documents produced including Ext.P7 minutes book of the Society/Bank. As per the decision of the managing committee of the bank, it is noted that impugned cheque which is in custody of the bank which has been obtained by the previous secretary has been presented and the same has been dishonoured and decided that the secretary/complainant is authorised to take further proceedings in the matter. It is mentioned in Ext.P7(a) decision that a sum of Rs.2, 83, 621/- is due from the previous secretary and the previous secretary has obtained the impugned cheque. It is evidenced that the previous secretary was suspended and subsequently he died. As stated above, it is the version in the minutes book that the impugned cheque was collected by the previous secretary. But PW1 has testified that when he demanded the amount, the accused came to the bank on 4.7.1996 and issued a cheque dated 4.8.1996. He was admitted in the cross examination that the cheque was given to him by the accused in response to his letter. The defence version suggested to PW1 in the cross examination as well as in Ext.P8 reply notice is that the previous secretary of the bank had some financial problems and through the husband of the accused, she issued the cheque just to save him at the time. It is also admitted by PW1 that there are Advance register and receipt issued by the accused but the same was not produced which is taken note of by the court below. I find that evidence of PW1 as to the issuance of the impugned cheque is contradictory to the version in Ext.P7(a) decision in the minutes book that the cheque was in the custody of bank as collected by the previous secretary. The version of PW1 is totally at variance with Ext.P7 (a) decision. Although the defence version that the accused only helped the previous secretary by giving blank cheque as hard to believe in view of the contradictions in the prosecution evidence, I find that no interference is called for in exercise of the appellate jurisdiction against acquittal. The Crl. Appeal is dismissed.Appeal dismissed"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE K. R. UDAYABHANU1. The appellant is the complainant in C.C.No.211/99 in the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Nedumangad with respect to the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.2. The case of the complainant is that a sum of Rs.1, 50, 000/- was borrowed by the complainant and towards the discharge of the above liability, the impugned cheque dated 25.3.1999 was issued and that the same when presented for encashment got dishonoured for want of funds in the account of the accused. The lawyer notice was sent demanding payment, but no reply received and further no payment was also made.3. The evidence adduced in the matter consisted the testimony of PWs' 1 to 3 and Exts. P1 to P10. The defence examined DWs' 1 and 2 and got marked Exts. D1 to D4. The defence version set up is that the accused had monetary dealings with DW2, the mother of the complainant and that he had borrowed a sum of Rs.65, 000/- from her and issued a blank cheque. The same was repaid and again a sum of Rs.20, 000/- was borrowed. The cheque was not returned. The blank cheque issued has been misused to file the complaint through the son of DW2. The trial court found that defence version is more probable and it was also held that the source to lend the amount by the complainant has not been properly established.4. I find that the evidence of PW1 as to the execution of the cheque is not vitiated by any pronounced infirmities. It is mentioned in the judgment of the court below that PW1 could not mention the said date of lending of the cheque. In the cross examination, he has stated that it was on 3rd January that he paid the amount to the accused. There was no specific contention that the complainant is not having the required source to lend the amount. It is seen that he has answered in the cross examination that two Angili trees and rubber trees were sold to one Muraleedharan Pillai in 1998. The above Muraleedharan Pillai was examined as DW1 who has deposed that the trees were purchased by him from the father of the complainant and the amount paid was Rs.44, 000/-. I find that the facts brought out from the examination of PW1 and DW2, the mother of the complainant would indicate that it cannot be held that he has not having the resources to lend the money although he was working as a typist in the Secretariat. It is in evidence that the accused had borrowed substantial sums from DW2, the mother of the complainant. It is seen from the evidence of DW2 that her husband was a bank employee and the accused was also working along with him and subsequently resigned the job and shifted to business. Concerning the above family background of the complainant it cannot held that he would not be having the resources to lend the amount. DW2, the mother of the complainant examined at the instance of the accused has not supported the version of the accused. I find that the execution of the cheque and the dishonour for want of funds in the account of the accused stands proved from the evidence of PWs' 1 to 3. PWs' 2 and 3 are the Bank Managers. The attempt to rebut the statutory presumptions through DWs' 1 and 2 has not succeeded.5. In the circumstances, I find that the findings of the courts below are liable to be set aside and I do so. The complainant has succeeded in establishing the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The accused is convicted for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and sentenced to imprisonment till the rising of the court and to pay a compensation of Rs.1, 50, 000/- and in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for three months. Respondent/accused is granted six months' time to pay the amount of compensation. He shall appear before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Nedumangad on 14.1.2008 to receive sentence.The criminal appeal is disposed of accordingly.Appeal disposed of"

The appellant is the complainant in C.C.No.789/97 with respect to the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 in which the accused was acquitted.2. The case of the complainant is that the accused borrowed a sum of Rs.2.5 lakhs and after repeated requests, towards the discharge of liability the accused issued the impugned cheque for Rs.50, 000/- drawn on SBT, Kayamkulam dated 21.5.1997 which when presented for encashment got dishonoured for want of sufficient funds in the account of the accused. The demand notice sent was not replied to nor was any amount paid.3. The evidence adduced in the matter consisted the testimony of PW1 and Exts. P1 to P8. The defence examined DW1, Bank Manager, who has proved Exts. D1 and D2, the copy of the D/D and D/D issue register respectively, and Exts. D3 which is the copy of the notice allegedly sent by the complainant. Ext.C1 the extract of the account of the accused was also proved through DW1.4. The trial court has found that the version of the complainant that he gave a loan of Rs.2.5 lakhs to the accused without any security appeared improbable. The defence version is that the amount borrowed was only Rs.50, 000/- and that the same was repaid on 1.3.1996 as per the D/D for the same amount. i.e., evidenced Exts. D1 and D2 and the evidence of DW1. It was noted that there is no documentary evidence at all to prove the lending of Rs.2.5lakhs to the complainant.5. The counsel for the appellant has strongly relied on Ext.P5 letter issued by the accused and produced by the complainant dated 3.4.1995 wherein it is mentioned that she is dispatching a sum of Rs.70, 000/- to the complainant through one Babu. According to the counsel, the total amount due from the accused was Rs.2.5 lakhs ; and Rs.70, 000/- as well as the D/D amount was paid towards the alleged loan of Rs.2.5 lakhs. I find that still a sum of Rs.80, 000/- would be due. There is no explanation for the same. The defence version is that Rs.7, 000/- paid was towards the amounts due from the husband of the accused. In the circumstances, the version of the defence appeared were probable. PW1 has also stated in the cross examination that the amount received through D/D was credited to the combined account of the accused and her husband. It is in the above circumstances, the trial court doubted the genuineness of the case set up that altogether a sum of Rs.2.5 lakhs was borrowed and Rs.50, 000/- was repaid by way of D/D and Rs.70, 000/- as per Ext. P5 letter. But, it is the case that only the impugned cheque has been issued towards the balance amount whereas the balance amount would be Rs.1.3lakhs. Of course, the accused has not stepped into the witness box nor has she sent a reply notice, but only on the basis of the above attitude of the accused she cannot be convicted unless the prosecution proves its case beyond reasonable doubt.6. In the circumstances, I find no reasons to interfere in the findings of the court below in exercise of the revisional jurisdiction.The appeal is dismissed.Appeal dismissed"

The revision petitioner, who is the accused in C.C.No.761/06 on the file of the JFCM-I, Thodupuzha for an offence punishable under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, filed CMP.No.12644/07 before the trial court to re-open the prosecution evidence as well as to permit him to adduce defence evidence. As per order dated 31.7.07, the Magistrate granted the second prayer but refused the first prayer. It is aggrieved by the refusal by the Magistrate to re-open the prosecution evidence that the petitioner has approached this court with the present revision.2. The evidence for the prosecution was closed on 16.9.06 and the case was thereafter posted for examination of the accused under section 313 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and after two or three postings the accused was finally examined on 20.10.06 under section 313 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. At a time when the case stood posted for defence evidence, the revision petitioner did not co-operate with the court and he eventually failed to appear before the court necessitating the initiation of proceedings under sections 82 and 83 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. On 28.6.07 the revision petitioner approached this court and filed the above petition.3. The complainant's evidence was recorded in the presence of the revision petitioner who had every opportunity to cross-examine the complainant's witnesses. The learned Magistrate was, therefore, fully justified in disallowing his request to re-open the prosecution evidence. The Magistrate, however, has been indulgent enough to permit the revision petitioner to adduce defence evidence. If he has got any defence in the matter, he can adduce whatever evidence he deems fit to substantiate the defence. He cannot, however, re-open the prosecution evidence since he himself has been at fault in not co- operating with the trial. I see no reason to interfere with the impugned order.This revision is accordingly dismissed.Petition dismissed"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE K. R. UDAYABHANU1. The appellant is the complainant in the proceedings initiated under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 on the allegation that the accused issued the impugned cheque for Rs.1, 60, 000/- dated 10.7.1998 towards the discharge of liabilities and that on presenting the cheque the same was returned for want of funds in the account of the accused. The lawyer notice sent was not replied to nor was the amount paid.2. The evidence adduced in the matter consisted the testimony of PW1, the complainant and Exts. P1 to P8.3. The trial court acquitted the accused only on the ground that the cheque was issued as security towards the debt and hence, it cannot be treated as the cheque issued towards the discharge of the liability. Evidently, the same is no longer the correct proposition of law in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in I.C.D.S. Ltd. vs. Beena Shabeer (2002 (3) KLT 218)2002 (3) KLT 2182002 ILO SC 1604. The court was relied on the version of PW1 brought out in the cross examination that it is after signing the cheque the amount was given. I find that the above sequence has no relevance as the cheque was issued towards the liability incurred immediately after signing the cheque. On the basis of the above answer brought out in the cross examination, it cannot be held that the cheque was issued not towards the discharge of the liability. Further, the accused has not sent reply notice on receipt of the notice demanding payment nor was any evidence adduced to rebut the statutory presumptions. As the version of PW1 do establish the fact that the cheque was executed and the documents produced revealed that there was no sufficient amount in the account of the accused to honour the cheque.4. The counsel for the respondent/accused has sought for an opportunity for him to further adduce evidence before the trial court. I find that there is no case that the accused was not afforded sufficient opportunity to adduce evidence in the matter. In the circumstances, I find that the request for getting the matter remitted is only to protract the proceedings and is liable to be rejected.5. In the circumstances, I find that the complainant has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The finding of the court below is set aside. The accused is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment till the rising of the court and to pay a compensation of Rs.1, 60, 000/- to the complainant and in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for three months. The revision petitioner is granted four months' time to pay the amount of compensation. He shall appear before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Chengannur on 12.11.2007 to receive the sentence.The criminal revision petition is disposed of as above.Petition disposed of"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE HARUN-UL-RASHID1. The petitioner herein is the defendant in O.S. No. 536/2005 on the file of Munsiff Court, Thiruvananthapuram. The suit was filed by the respondent herein as plaintiff for realisation of Rs. 77, 500/- with 12% interest. Annexure A1 is the true copy of the plaint in the said suit. The respondent in Paragraph 1 of Annexure A1 plaint has stated that he is an employee of H.M.T Kalamassery which is situated within the jurisdiction of Munsiff Court, Aluva.2. In paragraph 2 of Annexure A1 it is averred that the defendant issued a cheque drawn on State Bank of Travancore, Thrikkakkara Civil Station Branch, Ernakulam District. Since the cheque was returned unpaid with an endorsement 'funds insufficient', the said suit was filed for the aforementioned reliefs.3. The respondent also instituted S.T. No. 795/2004 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Thiruvananthapuram under Section 138 r/w Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 against the petitioner herein for proceeding against her for the offences punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act.4. The petitioner filed Transfer Petition (Crl) No. 10/2005 for transfer of S.T. No. 795/2004 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court -II, Thiruvananthapuram to one of the courts at Aluva. The petitioner met with a motor accident and sustained serious injuries and suffered 40% disability. Considering the above said facts and circumstances, this Court found that interest of justice warrants that the case has to be tried in a court nearer to Kalamassery where second respondent is employed. Accordingly, the transfer petition was allowed and the case was transferred to the Judicial First Class Magistrate-I, Aluva for trial and disposal.5. On a reading of Annexure A1 plaint, it can be seen that the plaintiff-respondent is working in H.M.T. Kalamassery within the jurisdiction of Munsiff Court, Aluva. The petitioner herein is also a resident of Kalamassery. The cheque allegedly was drawn on SBT, Ernakulam. According to the petitioner, only with the sole objective of obtaining unfair advantage over the petitioner, the respondent-plaintiff has sought to file the suit before the court at Thiruvananthapuram. It is also submitted by the counsel for the petitioner that the respondent-plaintiff is an employee of H.M.T, Kalamassery and he is residing at H.M.T quarters at Kamalassery and that the children of the respondent are also studying at Bhavan's Vidya Mandir, Kakkanad.6. According to the petitioner, with the obvious motive of harassing the petitioner, the respondent has sought to institute the criminal and civil proceedings against her at Thiruvananthapuram. According to her, since she being a disabled person and a lady aged more than 60 years, she will be put to severe hardships since she has to undertake constant trips to Thiruvananthapuram in connection with the case which was filed at Thiruvananthapuram.7. Finding that the petitioner is a 60 year old lady and had suffered major injuries in a motor vehicle accident and that she is a physically handicapped person, I am of the view that severe hardships will be caused to her by the pendency of suit before the Munsiff Court, Thiruvananthapuram.Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, I find that the interest of justice warrants that the case has to be transferred to the Munsiff Court, Aluva where the parties are residing. In the above circumstances, transfer petition is allowed. O.S. No. 536/2005 pending before the Munsiff Court, Thiruvananthapuram is transferred to Munsiff Court, Aluva for trial and disposal.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE M. SASIDHARAN NAMBIAR1. The defendant in O.S.3/2002 on the file of Sub Court, Payyannur is the appellant. Plaintiff is the respondent. Respondent instituted the suit seeking a decree for realisation of Rs.1, 07, 486/- with interest at 12% per annum from 22.10.01. According to respondent, along with the appellant, he was conducting a medical shop on a partnership basis by name Amritha medicals from 2.10.2000 and due to difference of opinion at the intervention of mediators, they decided to start separate business on 22.6.2001 and appellant agreed to pay Rs.1, 07, 486/- towards the share of the respondent on or before 22.10.2001 and also agreed to discharge all the other liabilities of the firm so that he could run that shop as his own and as the appellant could not pay the amount within the time stipulated, a fresh agreement, Ext.A1 was executed on 2.7.2001 with a stipulation to issue a cheque for discharge of Rs.1, 07, 486/- and also issued original of Ext.A2 post dated cheque agreeing to pay the amount and respondent was ready and willing to handover the drug licence to the appellant immediately on payment of the amount covered by the cheque, but appellant did not pay the amount and respondent presented cheque for encashment. It was dishonoured for insufficient funds. Respondent sent a notice dated 20.10.2001 demanding the amount covered by the cheque. Appellant sent a reply raising false contentions and therefore suit was instituted for realisation of the amount. Respondent has also initiated proceedings under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 separately. Appellant resisted the suit admitting the partnership business as well as the agreement. But it was contended that respondent did not take any preliminary steps to transfer the drug licence in the name of the appellant and appellant never intended to cheat the respondent and he has discharged the outstanding liability of Rs.13784/- as provided in Ext.A1 agreement. It was also contended that respondent has not given the account of medicine worth Rs.50, 000/- and at the time of separation of the partnership business respondent insisted to issue a cheque as security and therefore the cheque was issued as security and eventhough appellant demanded to transfer of drug licence in his name, respondent did not do so and he is not in a position to run the business and he sustained a loss and so respondent is not entitled to the decree sought for.2. Learned Sub Judge on the evidence of PW1, Dws.1 and 2 and Exts.A1 to A5 found that under Ext.A1, partnership business was discontinued and appellant was permitted to run the business by paying 1, 07, 486/- being the share of the respondent and towards that payment Ext.A2 cheque was issued which on presentation was dishonoured for want of sufficient funds and therefore respondent is entitled to realise the amount with interest and the suit was decreed. Appellant challenged the decree and judgment before District Court, Thalassery in A.S.270/2003. Learned Additional District Judge on reappreciation of evidence confirmed the findings of learned Sub Judge and dismissed the appeal. It is challenged in the second appeal.3. Learned counsel appearing for appellant was heard.4. The argument of learned counsel was under Ext.A1 agreement respondent has to transfer the drug licence in favour of the appellant to enable him to run the business and inspite of request it was not done by the respondent and therefore appellant could not enjoy the benefit provided under Ext.A1 and so he is not liable to pay the amount and hence the decree and judgment are unsustainable. Learned counsel also argued that Ext.A1 does not provide for payment of interest and courts below should not have granted interest and in any case interest at 12% from the date of the cheque is unsustainable.5. On hearing learned counsel, I do not find any substantial question of law involved in the appeal.6. Appellant and respondent were running a medical shop as a partnership firm by name Amritha Medicals from 2.10.2000. Because of difference of opinion they decided to discontinue the partnership business. Appellant was permitted to run the business after paying the share of the respondent. The share due to the respondent was fixed at Rs.1.07, 486/-. Ext.A1 agreement was executed stipulating the provisions. Under Ext.A1 appellant admitted that he is liable to pay Rs.1, 07, 486/- and will pay that amount on or before 22.10.2001. Eventhough appellant had earlier promised to pay the amount before the earlier period it was not paid. So a post-dated cheque was issued as provided in Ext.A1 agreement to enable the respondent to encash the cheque, if appellant fails to pay the amount before that date.The original of Ext.A2 cheque when presented was dishonoured for want of sufficient funds. Eventhough respondent sent Ext.A4 notice demanding the amount covered by the cheque, the amount was not paid. The suit was filed thereafter. The case of appellant is that as the respondent did not take steps to transfer the drug licence, he could not run the business and so he is not liable to pay the amount. Appellant had not even sent a notice demanding the transfer of the drug licence. If at all appellant sustained any loss, his remedy is to seek damages separately and he is not entitled to contend that he is not liable to pay Rs.1, 07, 486/- as agreed to be paid under Ext.A1. The courts below rightly appreciated the evidence and found that appellant is liable to pay the amount and gratned a decree.7. Then the only question is with regard to interest. True, Ext.A1 does not provide for payment of interest. But that does not mean that appellant is not liable to pay interest. It is clear from Ext.A1 that the amount due is under a commercial transaction. In such circumstance, the granting of interest at the rate of 12% from the date of the cheque cannot be said to be illegal. As no substantial question of law is involved in the appeal, appeal is dismissed in limine.Appeal dismissed"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE R. BASANT1. The petitioner is the complainant in a prosecution under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. At the fag end of the trial - it is submitted that even after the defence evidence of the case was closed, the accused filed an application for forwarding the cheque to the handwriting expert for examination and report as to whether the handwriting and signature in the cheque are that of the accused. The learned Magistrate, by Annexure III order allowed the said request. In coming to this conclusion, the learned Magistrate further observed that the accused has a definite contention from the very beginning of the case that the cheque was a forged one and a blank signed cheque which was given by him as security and the complainant has manipulated the same.2. The petitioner claims to be aggrieved by the said order. He has come to this court with a prayer to invoke the extraordinary inherent jurisdiction available to this court under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973.3. What is the ground? The law does not encourage challenge against interlocutory orders during the pendency of the proceedings. This policy of the law is clearly reflected in Section 397 (2) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 which proscribes revisional challenge against interlocutory orders. Under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the crucial question is whether there has been failure or miscarriage of justice or there is any abuse of the process of the court. In the light of the very specific and definite contention raised by the accused, as revealed in the impugned order that the cheque was a signed blank cheque manipulated and made use of by the complainant it cannot at all be held that the direction to send the cheque to the expert results in any failure or miscarriage of justice. I am, in these circumstances, satisfied that the challenge by the complainant/petitioner herein by invoking the jurisdiction under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is not justified.4. The learned counsel for the petitioner has a grievance that the proceedings were initiated as early as in 2002 and that the accused has resorted to this course only to delay and protract the proceedings. I am satisfied that a direction deserves to be issued to the learned Magistrate to ensure that the case is disposed of as expeditiously as possible. Every endeavour must be made to get the report of the expert expeditiously also.5. With the above observation, this petition is dismissed.Petition dismissed"

In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C.No. 965 of 2005 on the file of the J.F.C.M-I, Pathanamthitta challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice.Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the first respondent complainant by way of compensation under Sec. 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs. 25, 000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand only) within two months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence.5. Amount, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

After complying with all legal formalities, the complaint was filed. Apart from the complainant, the Bank Manager was also examined. No evidence was adduced on behalf of the revision petitioner. From the evidence available in the case, the trial court found him guilty under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and convicted and sentenced him to undergo simple imprisonment for six months. In appeal, the sentence was modified and instead of six month's imprisonment, he was sentenced to undergo imprisonment for three days and to pay a compensation of Rs.40, 000/= under Section 357(3) of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 with a default sentence of simple imprisonment for three months. It was also directed that if the amount was realised, Rs.37, 000/= shall be paid to the complainant as compensation. Both courts meticulously considered the evidence and imposed the sentence.

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.25, 000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only) [giving credit to the sum of Rs.10, 000/-(Rupees ten thousand only) deposited before the trial court pursuant to the direction by the first appellate court and which amount shall be permitted to be withdrawn by the 1st respondent complainant] within three months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Order accordingly"

In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C. No.557/1998 on the file of the J.F.C.M., Vaikom challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 2nd respondent complainant or deposits before the court below by way of compensation under section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.50, 000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only) within three weeks from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Order accordingly"

KOSHYPetitioner filed a complaint under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 against the first respondent alleging that the accused borrowed an amount of Rs.50, 000/= from the complainant on 13.6.1995 promising to repay the same with interest at the rate of 18% per annum. The cheque was dishonoured and complaint was filed after complying with the legal formalities. The trial court found that the complainant has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. The cheque was issued for a legally enforceable debt and cheque was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds. All the statutory formalities were complied with before filing the complaint. The accused was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for two months and also to pay a fine of Rs.50, 000/- and, in default of payment of fine, imprisonment for one month. In appeal, conviction was confirmed. However, sentence was modified and imprisonment was set aside and petitioner was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.5, 000/- and in default of payment of fine to undergo simple imprisonment for one month. In other words, the accused can escape by paying Rs.5, 000/- when he has executed cheque for Rs.50, 000/-. This was not the intended punishment that is required in a cheque dishonour case. I am of opinion that it is a case where sentence is to be interfered in revision. Therefore, sentence is modified. First respondent accused is sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment of one month and to deposit compensation of Rs.55, 000/-. If compensation is not paid within two months, there shall be a default sentence of three months. If compensation is realised, Rs.50, 000/- shall be paid to the complainant.The Criminal revision petition is allowed to the above extent.Petition allowed"

What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner.

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.1, 50, 000/- (Rupees one lakh and fifty thousand only) within six months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 2nd respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.5, 00, 000/- (Rupees five lakhs only) within six months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE K. THANKAPPAN1. This is a petition to special leave to appeal filed by the complainant in C.C.No.728/98 on the file of the Court of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-I, Muvattupuzha. In the complaint it is stated that the 1st respondent borrowed an amount of Rs.45, 000/- from the petitioner and in discharge of the above debt, he issued Ext.P1 cheque to the petitioner and when the cheque was presented for encashment, it was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds. To prove the case against the 1st respondent the complainant himself was examined as PW1 and Exts.P1 to P6 were marked. After closing the evidence on the side of the prosecution, the 1st respondent was questioned under section 313 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. He stated that he borrowed an amount of Rs.5, 000/- only from the petitioner and he entrusted Ext.P1 cheque as security. He also stated that even though he re-paid the amount, the cheque was not returned to him and on misusing the above cheque the complaint was filed. He further stated that the complaint was not maintainable as the complaint was filed beyond the statutory period. On the side of the defence, Ext.D1 was marked. Considering all these aspects and relying on a decision of the Apex Court reported in Uniplas India Ltd. V. Government of NCT of Delhi 2001(3) KLT 452001 (3) KLT 452001 ILO SC 310, the trial court found that the petitioner ought to have filed the complaint within the statutory period basing on Ext.D1 notice and hence offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 was not established against the 1st respondent. Therefore, the trial court acquitted the 1st respondent. Against the acquittal of the 1st respondent, the special leave to appeal has been filed by the petitioner.2. This Court gone through the judgment of the trial court. The trial court relied on Ext.D1 notice. As per Ext.D1 notice Ext.P1 cheque was dishonoured on 2-1-1998 and the complainant had already issued the notice on 14-1-1998 and hence he ought to have filed the complaint within the statutory period on the basis of Ext.D1 notice, but he did not file any complaint and the complaint was filed by presenting Ext.P1 cheque once again and sending a second notice on 5-5-1998. The trial court also relied on another decision of the Supreme Court reported in Sadanandan Bhadran V. Madhavan Sunil Kumar 1998(2) KLT 7651998 (2) KLT 7651998 ILO SC 1179, in which the Supreme Court held that the period of one month for filing the complaint would be reckoned from the day immediately following the day on which the period of fifteen days from the date of the receipt of the notice by the drawer. Hence, the trial court found that the complaint was not maintainable.3. Considering the entire facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is of the view that the impugned judgment requires any interference by this Court. Hence, leave to appeal is rejected.Order accordingly"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 2nd respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.1, 60, 000/- (Rupees one lakh and sixty thousand only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 2nd respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.3, 43, 000/- (Rupees three lakhs and forty three thousand only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.1, 65, 000/- (Rupees one lakh and sixty five thousand only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, deposited pursuant to orders of this court can be withdrawn by the 1st respondent complainant.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE K. THANKAPPAN1. Appellant was the complainant in C.C.No.676/1999 on the file of the Court of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class, Vadakara. As per the complaint, the 1st respondent borrowed an amount of Rs.1, 05, 000/- and in discharge of the above debt, he issued a cheque and when it was presented for encashment, the same was dishonoured on the ground of insufficiency of funds in the account of the 1st respondent. Hence, on complying the provisions regarding notice, reply etc., the complaint has been filed alleging that respondents 1 and 2 had committed an offence punishable under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. To prove the case against respondents 1 and 2, the petitioner himself was examined as PW1 and two other witnesses were examined as PWs.2 and 3 and Exts.P1 to P11 were marked. After closing the evidence adduced by the petitioner, the 1st respondent was questioned under section 313 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. He denied the prosecution allegation and stated that he purchased a bus from one Moosa on bona fide belief that Moosa was the registered owner and it was sold to one Andy. Since father of Moosa had filed a complaint before court sating that he was the registered owner of the bus, the bus was seized by the police and handed over possession to the father of Moosa. The 1st respondent had entered into an agreement with Andy and towards security of that agreement the 1st respondent issued 5 cheque leaves to Andy and one of the cheque leaves was misused for filing the complaint. Ext.D1 was produced on the side of the defence. After considering the entire evidence, the trial court found that there was no evidence to show that the appellant advanced Rs.1, 05, 000/- to the 1st respondent and towards discharge of that debt, he issued Ext.P1 cheque and hence an offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 was not attracted. Aggrieved by the above, the petitioner has approached this Court by filing the appeal.2. Heard both sides.3. The specific contention of the appellant is that the cheque in question was issued by the 1st respondent in discharge of an amount of Rs.1, 05, 000/- alleged to have been borrowed by the 1st respondent. The trial court found that the appellant was not having any transaction with the 1st respondent and he was acting as a benami for somebody. It has come out in evidence that even though the appellant stated that he used to write the account of the 2nd respondent firm, he was not aware what is the business done by the 2nd respondent firm. The trial court found that the evidence adduced by PWs.1 to 3 was sufficient to show that the case put forward by the 1st respondent was more probable. The trial court also found that there was no evidence to show that Rs.1, 05, 000/- was legally due to the appellant from the 1st respondent.4. On considering the entire evidence, this Court finds that the judgment of the trial court requires no interference by this Court. Hence, the appeal fails and it stands dismissed.Appeal dismissed"

The case has reached the stage of defence evidence. It is submitted at the Bar that the petitioner had applied for permission to examine himself as a witness under Section 315 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The said request has been allowed also. But the petitioner could not appear before the learned Magistrate on the date to which the case was posted for such examination of the petitioner as a defence witness. The petitioner applied for time. It is submitted at the Bar that no orders have been passed in such application for adjournment to facilitate examination of the petitioner.2. Be that as it may, the petitioner has now come to this Court with a prayer that the learned Magistrate may be directed to grant the petitioner reasonable further time to examine himself. That is the short prayer made in this Crl.M.C. It is for the petitioner to make such request before the learned Magistrate and the learned Magistrate must consider the same and pass appropriate orders. I am not persuaded to agree that any specific direction can or need be issued invoking the powers under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Needless to say, the petitioner can seek time to examine himself as a defence witness and the learned Magistrate must pass appropriate orders in such application. If the petitioner is aggrieved by the final disposal of the case without a reasonable opportunity to him to adduce his evidence and substantiate his contentions, the same shall be a ground available to him to challenge the verdict of the Magistrate if such challenge be necessary.3. This Crl.M.C. is accordingly dismissed with the above observations.4. Hand over the order.Petition dismissed"

Cognizance has been taken. Consequent to the non-appearance of the petitioner, a non-bailable warrant of arrest was issued by the learned Magistrate against the petitioner. The petitioner approached the learned Sessions Judge for anticipatory bail. Directions were issued in her favour. She was directed to surrender before the learned Magistrate on 25/6/07. She did not so surrender. Later, she approached the learned Sessions Judge again for extension of time. The learned Sessions Judge did not grant the said request.2. According to the petitioner, she is absolutely innocent. There was no wilful default on her part to appear. The petitioner is a woman aged about 62 years. She had no information about the pendency of the proceedings. It is, in these circumstances, that she approached the learned Sessions Judge for anticipatory bail. On the date specified by the learned Sessions Judge i.e., 25/6/07, the petitioner could not appear on account unavoidable reasons. In these circumstances, the learned Sessions Judge must have granted extension of time, it is submitted.3. I am satisfied that it is for the petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate and explain to the learned Magistrate the circumstances under which she could not earlier appear before the learned Magistrate. I have no reason to assume that the learned Magistrate would not consider the petitioner's application for regular bail on merits in accordance with law and expeditiously. No special or specific directions appear to be necessary. Every court must do the same. Sufficient general directions on this aspect have already been issued in the decision reported in Alice George v. Deputy Superintendent of Police (2003 (1) KLT 339)2003 (1) KLT 339.4. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is dismissed; but with the observation that if the petitioner surrenders before the learned Magistrate and seeks bail after giving sufficient prior notice to the Prosecutor in charge of the case, the learned Magistrate must proceed to pass appropriate orders on merits and expeditiously - on the date of surrender itself.5. I make it clear that the fact that the petitioner had not appeared before the learned Magistrate on 25/6/07, as directed by the learned Sessions Judge initially, shall not, in any way, weigh with the learned Magistrate while considering the application for regular bail.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE R. BASANT1. The petitioner is the accused in a prosecution under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The first respondent is the complainant. The learned Magistrate has found the petitioner guilty and has convicted and sentenced him to undergo S.I. for a period of three months and to pay an amount of Rs.2, 60, 000/- to the complainant as compensation and in default to undergo S.I. for a period of two months. The petitioner has not challenged the verdict of guilty, conviction and sentence so far. The time prescribed for preferring the appeal is already over.2. The petitioner submits that he has subsequently settled the dispute with the complainant. He therefore wants the verdict of guilty, conviction and sentence to be set aside invoking the powers under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The counsel relies on the decision in Sabu George V. Home Secretary (2007 (1) KLT 982)2007 (1) KLT 9822007 ILO KER 30 in support of his contention that such quashing of proceedings is possible even after the decision has become final. The petitioner has certainly a remedy of preferring an appeal against the verdict of guilty, conviction and sentence. Of course, the time prescribed under law for preferring the appeal is already over. But the Appellate Court is certainly legally competent to condone the delay and entertain the appeal.3. According to the petitioner, there is a change in circumstance and that is what obliges him to come to court now. That change in circumstance can certainly be urged as a reason to explain the delay and a prayer can be made to condone the delay in filing the appeal. I find no reason why the appellate court informed of the subsequent settlement of a compoundable offence like the one under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 should not choose to invoke its powers to condone the delay and entertain the appeal and accept the composition.4. The decision in Sabu George cannot be reckoned as authority for the proposition that all composition hereafter can be accepted by the High Court by invoking the powers under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. That was an exceptional case where the parties had no other remedy in the State to avoid the verdict of guilty, conviction and sentence, which verdict would have compelled the accused to undergo incarceration in prison. In an exceptional case in aid of justice such power can be invoked to accept a post-revision composition of the offence committed. That and that alone is laid down in Sabu George. I am of the opinion that the attempt to invoke the dictum in Sabu and avoid the burden to prefer an appeal is totally misconceived. The request cannot be accepted.5. This Writ Petition is accordingly dismissed. I may hasten to repeat that the dismissal of this writ petition will not in any way fetter the rights of the petitioner to move the appellate court along with an application for condonation of delay in filing the appeal and to report composition of the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.Petition dismissed"

He has a sad tale of woes to narrate. According to him, he is suffering from heart ailments. He has retired from service. He is hard pressed of money. The respondent is a friend of his, who has defrauded him by not making the payment due to him. He is badly and urgently in need of money. The short prayer of the petitioner is that the case against the respondent pending before the learned Magistrate may be disposed of expeditiously.2. Has the petitioner applied to the learned Magistrate? Evidently he has not. Why has the petitioner rushed to this court without and before making such a prayer before the learned Magistrate? No satisfactory explanations are forthcoming except that the petitioner faces a very unfortunate plight. It is, in these circumstances, that the petitioner has come before this court for an out of turn early disposal of the case initiated by him, submits counsel.3. I have sympathy for the petitioner. His complaint numbered in 2006 remains without disposal even now though the prosecution is for the simple offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. But it is certainly for the petitioner to approach the learned Magistrate and claim an early disposal of his case. I have no reason to assume that the learned Magistrate would not sympathetically consider the plight of the petitioner. But the petitioner must certainly follow the discipline and make an application before the learned Magistrate. Without and before doing that, there is no justification in his rushing to this court with such an application.4. In the result, this petition is dismissed. But I may hasten to observe that it shall be open to the petitioner to make an application for expeditious disposal of the case before the learned Magistrate. Needless to say, the learned Magistrate must consider the same appropriately and pass expeditious orders on merits.Hand over copy of this order to the learned counsel for the petitioner.Order accordingly"

To prove the case against the 1st respondent, the petitioner herself was examined as PW1 and Exts.P1 to P5 were marked. After closing the evidence adduced by the petitioner, the 1st respondent was questioned under section 313 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. He denied the allegation in the complaint and stated that he had no transaction with the petitioner. He also stated that an amount of Rs.50, 000/- has been borrowed from the husband of the petitioner in connection with the marriage of a relative of him and at the time of availing the amount the wife of the 1st respondent had transferred 10 cents of property as security in the name of the petitioner and along with the same the 1st respondent had entrusted a blank cheque as collateral security to the husband of the petitioner and even after repayment of the amount the cheque was not returned to him and that cheque was misused by the petitioner for filing the complaint. To prove the case, DWs.1 to 3 were examined and Exts.D1 and D2 were marked. After considering the entire evidence the trial court found that the petitioner did not succeed to establish the issuance of Ext.P1 cheque by the 1st respondent in consideration of the amount mentioned therein and hence no liability could be fastened on the 1st respondent for offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 .2. After considering the entire evidence and after going through the records made available to this Court, this Court is of the view that the finding of the trial court is on evidence and it requires no interference by this Court.

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.51, 000/- (Rupees fifty one thousand only) [giving credit to the sum of Rs.25, 000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only) deposited pursuant to orders passed by the lower appellate court and which can be withdrawn by the 1st respondent complainant] within three months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE V. RAMKUMAR1. In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C. No.973/2003 on the file of the J.F.C.M.-II, Kollam challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against her for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. The defence raised by the revision petitioner was that he had no transaction at all with the complainant and that the transaction was really with one Asokan with whom he had entrusted the cheque in question and this aspect of his defence was spoken to by DW1 and according to the revision petitioner DW1 has been disbelieved by the court below merely for the reason that he is related to the accused.4. If the case of the revision petitioner is that the cheque in question was entrusted with Asokan with whom alone he had transaction and that the complainant is a stranger to the transaction, one would have expected him to examine Asokan as a witness. He was not examined. That apart, one would have expected him to issue at least a notice to Asokan informing him that he had misused the cheque entrusted with him, by handing over the same to the complainant without the consent or knowledge of the revision petitioner. That was also not done. This, coupled with the fact that he did not even choose to send a reply to the statutory notice constitutes sufficient grounds to repel the defence developed only at the stage of evidence. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.5. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided she complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 2nd respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.1, 25, 000/- (Rupees one lakh and twenty five thousand only) within four months from today, then she need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, she shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

THANKAPPANThis is an application for special leave to appeal against the judgment in C.C.No.74/2007 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class-III, Kottarakkara. As per the complaint filed by the petitioner/complainant, the 2nd respondent/accused had borrowed an amount of Rs.1, 50, 000/= from the petitioner/complainant on 3.7.2005 and in discharge of the said amount, the 2nd respondent had issued Ext.P1 cheque in favour of the petitioner on 8.7.2005. When the cheque was presented for encashment, the same has been dishonoured on the ground of insufficiency of fund with the account of the 2nd respondent/accused. Complying the provisions regarding notice etc., the complaint has been filed before the court alleging that the 2nd respondent had committed the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. To prove the case against the 2nd respondent, the petitioner himself was examined as PW1 and relied on Exts.P1 to P6. On closing the evidence adduced on behalf of the petitioner, the 2nd respondent/accused was questioned under Section 313 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Denying the allegations in the complaint, the 2nd respondent/accused has stated that the cheque in question was not issued in favour of the petitioner either to return an amount of Rs.1, 50, 000/= which was borrowed by him as stated in the complaint whereas the same ccheque was issued as a security for getting a job being arranged by one Swami Preethathmanand in the S.N.D.P Devaswom. The further case of the 2nd respondent was that the cheque and an amount of Rs.1, 50, 000/= were also entrusted to the said Swami Preethathmanand. But, no job was given and said cheque in question issued as security has been misused by the petitioner for filing the complaint against him. It was also the case of the 2nd respondent that so many criminal cases are pending against the said Swamiji and C.C.No.1465/2005 is also pending against him. After considering the entire evidence , the trial court found that the petitioner/complainant miserably failed to prove that the cheque in question was issued in discharge of a legally enforcible debt. To come to this conclusion, the trial court also relied on the evidence of DW1, who was examined on behalf of the 2nd respondent, and also relied on Ext.D1 notice. The trial court found that the 2nd respondent had introduced the said Swamiji to the complainant/petitioner. On believing the evidence of DW1 and the case set up by the 2nd respondent, the trial court found that the petitioner failed to prove that the cheque in question was issued in favour of the petitioner in discharge of any legally enforcible debt even if it was issued as security for liability of a 3rd party as set up by the petitioner. There is no evidence to prove the case before the lower court. In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the leave application is merit less and it is dismissed.Application dismissed"

The petitioner finds a warrant of arrest issued by the learned J.F.C.M.-IV, Ernakulam in a prosecution under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 chasing him. The name of the petitioner is R.Chandran. He is son of Raman Nadar. Admittedly he is the Proprietor of Venkiteswara Films, T.C.24/593, Thycaud, Trivandrum. According to him, he does not know the complainant at all. He is not the account holder of the cheque in question drawn on Catholic Syrian Bank, though the said cheque is also seen signed by the Proprietor of Venkiteswara Films. According to the petitioner, it is not his signature which appears in the cheque. According to the petitioner, the cheque is not drawn on an account maintained by the petitioner at all. It is an account maintained by somebody else. The petitioner is being proceeded against unnecessarily. This is the grievance raised by the petitioner. The warrant of arrest is chasing him. Hence he is unable to appear before the learned Magistrate.2. After discussions at the Bar, I am satisfied that appropriate directions can be issued as requested and agreed by the learned counsel to resolve this unnecessary controversy.3. This Crl.M.C. is accordingly allowed in part. The following directions are issued under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973.(1) The warrant of arrest issued against the petitioner in S.T. 1228 of 2005 by the J.F.C.M. -IV, Ernakulam shall not be executed till the next date of posting.(2) The petitioner shall appear before the learned Magistrate on the next date of posting. The learned Magistrate shall ascertain from the petitioner whether the petitioner is the one he wants to prosecute. Even if the complainant asserts that the petitioner is the one, against whom he wants to proceed, the petitioner shall be released on his executing a bond without any sureties. He shall appear again on the next day as directed by the learned Magistrate and seek regular bail.(3) The learned Magistrate shall certainly consider the grievance of the petitioner that he is not really the person, who is arrayed as an accused in the complaint. Appropriate orders shall be passed on merits after giving opportunities to both sides to adduce evidence on that contention in the course of trial, if the complainant asserts that the petitioner is the real accused.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE K. R. UDAYABHANU1. The revision petitioner is the accused who stands convicted for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and sentenced to undergo S.I. for three months and to pay a fine of Rs.50, 000/- and in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for one month.2. The case of the complainant is that the accused had received a sum of Rs.1, 00, 000/- from the complainant agreeing to arrange employment in Kerala Electricals & Allied Industries, Kundara and that he failed to provide such employment and in discharge of the liability he issued a cheque dated 30.10.1994 which when presented got dishonoured for want of funds in the account of the accused. The lawyer notice sent demanding the amount was willfully got received.3. The evidence adduced in the matter consisted of the testimony of PWs' 1 and 2 and Exts. P1 to P7. The defence got examined DWs' 1 and 2.4. PW1 is the complainant and PW2 is the bank Manager. The execution of the cheque stands proved from the evidence of PW1 and the dishonour for want of funds in the account of the accused from the evidence of PW2. DW2 is the father of the complainant. DW1 is the witness examined in support of the version of the accused that the blank cheque was issued by the accused to DW2, the father of the complainant in January, 1994 while DW2 was the Regional Transport Officer as commission for a vehicle transaction. DW2, the father of the complainant examined at the instance of the defence has flatly denied the above allegation. DW2 has also stated that he was working as Regional Transport Officer, Kollam only from May 1994 vide G.O.(Rt.) 893/94 dated 26.4.1994. Both the courts have concurrently found that the testimony of PW1 and DW1 as to the execution of the cheque stands established. The statutory presumptions could not be dislodged by the evidence of DW1. In the circumstances, I find no reason to deviate from the concurrent findings of the courts below as to the execution of the cheque and the conviction. The conviction is confirmed.5. The trial court had imposed simple imprisonment for three months and to pay a fine of Rs.1, 25, 000/- is ordered to be paid to the complainant. Strangely, the appellate court modified the sentence and reduced the fine amount to Rs.50, 000/-. I find that there is no justification for the above reduction. In the circumstances, the sentence is modified to imprisonment till the rising of the court and to pay a compensation of Rs.1, 20, 000/- to the complainant and in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for three months. The revision petitioner/accused is granted six months' time to remit the amount of compensation. He shall appear before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, Punalur on 12.3.2008 to receive the sentence.The criminal revision petition is disposed of accordingly.Petition disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.68, 000/- (Rupees sixty eight thousand only) [giving credit to Rs.25, 000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only) deposited by the revision petitioner pursuant to orders of this court and which can be withdrawn by the 1st respondent complainant] within six months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C.

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.31, 000/- (Rupees thirty one thousand only) within three months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.80, 000/- (Rupees eighty thousand only) within three months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

It was contended by the respondents that prior to the death of Sri.Sundaran Nadar in 1987 the entire property had been conveyed by him and therefore as on the date of compromise decree no estate survived him. In other words, the contention was that the respondents were not legal representatives of Sri.Sundaran Nadar in the sense that they had not inherited any assets.2. Heard both sides. Sri.Vinod J.Dev, counsel for the petitioner invited my attention to Section 53 of Transfer Of Property Act, 1882 and submitted that the settlement deed of 1997 relied on by the respondents is executed during the pendency of criminal proceedings initiated against Sri.Sundaran Nadar under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Sri.Sundaran Nadar Died only on 11.10.99 and the criminal case was closed only on 16.10.99. The settlement deed according to the learned counsel was obviously a fraudulent transaction created with the objective of defeating creditors like the petitioner.3. Sri.M.Balagovindan, Learned counsel for the respondent however would refer to the Law Lexicon and submit that an inheritance means an estate descended to the heir immediately on the death of the ancestor by virtue of his right or representation as a descendant. It is cast upon the latter by operation of law. In the instant case there was no estate for Sri.Sundaran Nadar to survive him and it could not be said that the respondents have become owners of the property sought to be attached by 'inheritance'.The dictionary meaning of 'inheritance' notwithstanding, I do not think that it will be proper to adopt the dictionary meaning and repel the contention of the petitioner which is to the effect that the settlement deed put in defence itself is a fraudulent transaction which is liable to be ignored by the court and the creditors. Of course, Section 53 will show that, it is for the creditors to have the allegedly fraudulent transaction avoided by initiating action. But now it is fairly settled that a contention that the document is fraudulent can be raised even while defending an action or while resisting a claim. Under the impugned order the implications of Section 53 of Transfer Of Property Act, 1882 is not even considered by the learned Munsiff. I set aside the impugned order and direct the learned Munsiff to pass fresh orders after considering the implications of Section 53 of Transfer Of Property Act, 1882.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE R. BASANT1. The petitioner faces indictment in a prosecution under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The cheque is for an amount of Rs.33, 500/- and is dated 01/12/2004. Prosecution was initiated as early as in 2005. The petitioner has not entered appearance so far. The petitioner had received summons from the court but on account of reasons beyond his control, it became impossible for him to appear before the learned Magistrate, it is submitted. His absence was not wilful; but was on account of reasons beyond his control.2. According to the petitioner, he is absolutely innocent. The petitioner is willing to pay the cheque amount to the complainant along with reasonable interest. But the complainant, in his anxiety to vex and harass the petitioner, is not willing to compound the case. The matter hence drags on unnecessarily. The petitioner now wants to surrender before the learned Magistrate and seek regular bail. But he apprehends that his application for regular bail may not be considered by the learned Magistrate on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. He, therefore, prays that directions under Section 438 and/or 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 may be issued to the learned Magistrate to release the petitioner on bail when he appears and applies for bail.3. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that to show his bonafides, the petitioner shall deposit the cheque amount with interest before the learned Magistrate within a period of fifteen days.4. Having considered all the relevant inputs, I am persuaded to agree that directions under Section 438/482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 can be issued in favour of the petitioner. I am impressed by the offer made by the learned counsel for the petitioner to deposit an amount of Rs.45, 000/- before the learned Magistrate to show his bona fides.5. This petition is, in these circumstances, allowed.Following directions are issued under Section 438/482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973.i) The petitioner shall surrender before the learned Magistrate at 11 a.m on 22/9/2007. Till then the non-bailable warrant issued against him shall not be executed.ii) He shall be released on regular bail on condition that he deposits an amount of Rs.45, 000/- (Rupees forty five thousand only) and executes a bond for Rs.25, 000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the learned Magistrate.6. The learned Magistrate shall record the plea of the accused on the date of surrender and shall thereafter permit him to be represented by his counsel. Subsequent personal presence of the petitioner shall be insisted only if it is absolutely necessary for the further progress of the case. I record the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that if the complainant is willing to accept the said amount and compound the same, the entire amount can be released to the complainant forthwith.Hand over copy of this order to the learned counsel for the petitioner.Order accordingly"

Even though he raised a defence that his prosecution was bad without the prosecution of the firm of which he was a Partner, the courts below have concurrently repelled the said defence and convicted him for the said offence. But the sentence imposed on the 1st respondent was one of simple imprisonment for three months and to pay a fine of Rs.5, 000/- (Rupees five thousand only) which was directed to be paid as compensation under section 357(1) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973.2. The main ground which is urged in support of this revision by the complainant is that the courts below should have directed the cheque amount of Rs.7, 250/- (Rupees seven thousand two hundred and fifty only) as compensation instead of limiting the same to Rs.5, 000/- (Rupees five thousand only) by way of fine. I see some force in the said submissions. For the 1st respondent accused also, I do not think that penal servitude by way of incarceration beyond the rising of the court is warranted. Accordingly, I am inclined to reduce the sentence of imprisonment for three months to imprisonment till the rising of the court and direct the 1st respondent accused to pay to the revision petitioner/ complainant the cheque amount of Rs.7, 250/- (Rupees seven thousand two hundred and fifty only) by way of compensation under section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 within two months from today, failing which he shall suffer simple imprisonment for one month.This revision is allowed in part as above.Petition allowed"

The revision petitioner is the accused who stands convicted for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and sentenced to undergo S.I. for three months and to pay a fine of Rs.1, 000/- and in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for two weeks.2. The prosecution case is that on 14.9.1993, the Food Inspector purchased milk from the first accused, the Honorary Secretary of Vilappil Ksheera Vyavasaya Sahakarana Sangam Ltd. No.3116, Peyad and the same was found to be adulterated.3. The evidence adduced in the matter consisted the testimony of PWs' 1 to 4 and Exts. P1 to P33. The defence examined DW1.4. The contention raised by the counsel for the revision petitioner is that the offence will not be attracted in view of the proviso to Section 10(2) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, that milk being a primary food cannot be taken as sample if it is not intended for sale as such food. It is the contention that the Society involved is a primary milk Co-operative Society and the Society was collecting milk from the individual suppliers and selling the same to Milma and that there was no direct retail sale. It is seen that both the courts below have not considered the above aspect of the case. It is also contended that A1/revision petitioner is only the honorary Secretary and is not actively involved in the affairs of the Society. It is true that A1 Food Inspector purchased the milk. It is the contention that the proviso to Section 10(2) is attracted is raised when the witnesses were cross examined. It was put to PW1 the Food Inspector that there is no direct sale to the customers from the Society. The Food Inspector denied the same. PW2, the witness for the prosecution has stated that PW2 the witness to the prosecution who is also Salesman of the Society has testified that the function of the Society is to collect milk and sell it to the diary and the diary fixed the price as per the chart after ascertaining the quantity of the fat etc. His function is only to collect the milk, measuring the same and taking into diary. PW4, the independent witness, has also stated that he is a member of the Society for the last about 8 years and the Society is functioning under the Diary Development Board. He was also supplying milk to the Society.5. In the circumstances and in view of the suggestion in the cross examination of PW1 and the evidence of PWs' 2 and 4 it appears that the contention of the counsel for the revision petitioner that the Society concerned was a primary Co-operative Society supplying milk to Milma appears true. Hence, I find that the proviso to Section 10(2) will apply in the instance case. Hence, the decision of the courts below are set aside. The accused/revision petitioner is acquitted.The criminal revision petition is allowed.Petition allowed"

In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C. No.1234 of 2002 on the file of the J.F.C.M-III, Punalur challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice.4. Learned counsel for the revision petitioner made the following further submissions before me:-The accused was the contractor of Punalur Municipality where the complainant was an employee. The cheque in question was a signed blank cheque managed to be obtained by the complainant from the accused for sanctioning the bill in favour of the accused and the complainant was misusing the said cheque. The complainant Vijayarajan died pending the proceedings before the trial court and his wife Ushakumari was permitted to continue the proceedings and it was she who was examined as PW1. Since PW1 did not know anything about the transaction set up by the defence, the accused did not adduce any evidence to substantiate his defence.5. Both the courts below did not accept the above contentions. The fact that PW1 was not able to confirm or deny the suggestion put to her with regard to the defence version, will not amounts to proof of the defence story. The accused did not mount the witness box nor did he examine any witness in support of the above version.6.Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.7. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence in the light of the recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court that no default sentence can be imposed for an order for compensation under Section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The sentence imposed on the revision petitioner is set aside and instead he is sentenced to pay fine of Rs.30, 000/-(Rupees thirty thousand only)(giving credit to the sum of Rs.20, 000/- deposited before the trial court pursuant to the orders passed by the lower appellate court and which amount shall be allowed to be withdrawn by PW1 wife of the complainant) which shall be deposited within five months from today and on default to make the payment, he shall suffer simple imprisonment for three months. The fine amount shall be paid as compensation under Section 357(1) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence.I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence in the light of the recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court that no default sentence can be imposed for an order for compensation under Section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The sentence imposed on the revision petitioner is set aside and instead he is sentenced to pay fine of Rs.3, 05, 000/-(Rupees three lakhs and five thousand only) which shall be deposited within five months from today and on default to make the payment, he shall suffer simple imprisonment for three months. Out of the fine amount, the cheque amount of Rs.3, 00, 000/-(Rupees three lakhs only) shall be paid as compensation under Section 357(1) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding.The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence in the light of the recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court that no default sentence can be imposed for an order for compensation under Section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The sentence imposed on the revision petitioner is set aside and instead he is sentenced to pay fine of Rs.1, 25, 000/-(Rupees one lakh and twenty thousand only) which shall be deposited within five months from today and on default to make the payment, he shall suffer simple imprisonment for three months. Out of the fine amount, the cheque amount of Rs.1, 20, 000/-(Rupees one lakh twenty thousand only) shall be paid as compensation under Section 357(1) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE V. RAMKUMAR1. In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C. No.1047 of 2000 on the file of the J.F.C.M, Mavelikkara challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice.4. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner made the following further submission before me:-The specific case of the revision petitioner during examination under Section 313 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 was that she is not the holder of the account from which Ext.P1 cheque was issued. DW1, the Manager of the drawee bank has deposed that even though the account in question pertains to S. Majitha which is the name of the accused, the address shown in the account is different. So the complainant has not discharged the initial burden of proving that the cheque was issued from the account maintained by the accused. Hence, the prosecution of the accused for the aforesaid offence was bad.5.I am afraid I cannot agree with the above submission. First of all, the accused did not send a reply to the statutory notice issued to her. No doubt, PW1, the Manager had deposed that the address shown in the account is different from the address shown for the accused, though the names are the same. It was not even put to PW1 during her cross examination that the cheque in question does not relate to the account maintained by the accused or that it does not contain the signature of the accused. When the accused had no reply to the statutory notice and had no suggestion to be put to PW1 that she is not the account holder and that the signature in the Ext.P1 is not that of hers, it was too late in the day for her to come out with such a contention.6. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.7. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence in the light of the recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court that no default sentence can be imposed for an order for compensation under Section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The sentence imposed on the revision petitioner is set aside and instead he is sentenced to pay fine of Rs.55, 000/-(Rupees fifty five thousand only) and on default to make the payment, he shall suffer simple imprisonment for three months. Out of the fine amount, the cheque amount of Rs.50, 000/-(Rupees fifty thousand only) shall be paid a compensation under Section 357(1) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Fine amount shall be deposited within four months from today.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE V. RAMKUMAR1. In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C. No. 58 of 2004 on the file of the J.F.C.M, Koyilandy challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice.4. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner made the following further submissions:-The actual amount due was only Rs.52, 000/- and the balance amount of Rs.50, 000/- was incorporated so as to make a total amount of Rs. 1, 02, 000/-. The case of the complainant that the amount due was Rs.1, 45, 952/- was not true.5. Both the courts below did not accept the defence case. The issuance of Ext.P1 cheque by filling of the entries therein was admitted by the accused. The signature therein was also admitted as that of his. According to the complainant, there were continuous transactions between the complainant and the accused and some of the cheques issued by the accused towards liability had been dishonoured for want of funds in the account of the accused. Finally the accounts were settled and on verification of account, an amount of Rs.1, 45, 952/-was found due in September, 2002. A cheque issued by the accused for the said amount was also dishonoured and subsequently, Ext.P1 cheque was issued for a sum of Rs.1, 02, 000/- promising to pay the balance amount within three months.6.Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.7. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the first respondent complainant by way of compensation under Sec. 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.1, 05, 000/- (Rupees one lakh and five thousand only) within five months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence.5. Amount, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE V. RAMKUMAR1. In this revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C. No.633/2003 on the file of the J.F.C.M., Adimaly challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice.4. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner made the following further submissions before me:-The specific case of the revision petitioner was that the transaction set up by the complainant was false and that Ext.P1 was a signed blank cheque which he had entrusted with one George while an employee of the revision petitioner availed a loan from the said George. The cheque was offered as a security for the loan availed by the employee and the same was misutilised by the said George by handing it over to the complainant's brother who in turn was passing it on to the complainant.5.This version of the revision petitioner was not believed by the courts below. If the cheque was entrusted with one George as alleged, George would have been the best person to be cited as a witness. At least the petitioner could have cited the employee for whom he claims to have stood as a surety. That was also not done. Instead, the person who was examined as DW1 is one who claims to have witnessed the aforesaid transaction. If such a transaction as alleged by the accused had taken place, then as a reasonable and prudent man, the revision petitioner would have proceeded against the said George for betraying the confidence reposed in him. But, for reasons best known to the revision petitioner, no steps appear to have been taken against the said George. Equally misconceived is the request of the revision petitioner to send the cheque to the handwriting expert for ascertaining the age of the writings on the cheque. When the transaction set up by the revision petitioner itself was not proved, there was no need for sending the cheque to the handwriting expert. It is pertinent to note that the revision petitioner did not send any reply also to the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below.The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.6. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 2nd respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.60, 000/- (Rupees sixty thousand only) within five months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence.Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and thatthe Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below.The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.37, 500/- (Rupees thirty seven thousand and five hundred only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

The petitioner/accused and the respondent/ complainant have now come before this Court with a prayer that the composition which has been effected at the post revision stage may be accepted and the verdict of guilty, conviction and sentence may be set aside invoking the powers under Sec.482 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 as explained in the dictum in Sabu George v. Home Secretary (2007 (1) KLT 982)2007 (1) KLT 9822007 ILO KER 30.3. The learned counsel for the respondent confirms that the matter has been settled and that the complainant has no further grievance whatsoever against the petitioner.4. If this Court were not to accept the composition, the petitioner would be compelled to undergo the substantive sentence of simple imprisonment for a period of one year. I am satisfied, in the facts and circumstances of this case, that this is an eminently fit case where the dictum in Sabu George v. Home Secretary (2007 (1) KLT 982)2007 (1) KLT 9822007 ILO KER 30 must come to the rescue of the petitioner.5. In the result:(a) This Crl.M.C. is allowed.(b) The verdict of guilty, conviction and sentence imposed on the petitioner in C.C. No.613/92 passed by the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class, Perumbavoor, as upheld in Crl.A. No.150/94 by the Additional Sessions Judge, North Parur, is hereby set aside.Petition allowed"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding.The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.70, 000/- (Rupees seventy thousand only) within five months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence.Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding.The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.1, 03, 000/- (Rupees one lakh and three thousand only) within five months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : R. BASANTCan composition of an offence under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 even after the conviction and sentence have become final after the judgments of the trial, appellate and revisional courts be accepted?(ii) If so, which court is to accept the same? Has the trial court, appellate court or the revisional court powers to accept such composition?(iii) If no such court can accept such composition, can this court invoke its Constitutional powers under Article 226 of the Constitution Of India, 1950 or the original extraordinary inherent power under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to accept the composition and relieve the accused of the obligation to undergo the sentence of imprisonment?2. These questions of importance arise for consideration in these petitions. As the questions raised were reckoned by me as important and vital, I had sought the assistance, which I get in good measure too, of Shri.S.Sreekumar, Standing Counsel for the C.B.I. and Shri.T.G. Rajendran, Advocate. All counsel have been heard in detail.3. To the vital facts first. Crl.M.C. 259 of 2007 and Crl.M.A. 8626 of 2006 in Crl.R.P.No. 7 of 2004 are both filed by some accused in a prosecution under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The verdict of guilty, conviction and sentence on him have become final and the said petitioner now faces a sentence of S.I. for a period of six months and to pay a fine of Rs. 1, 60, 000/- and in default to undergo S.I. for a period of four months. If the fine is realised, an amount of Rs. 1, 58, 000/- has been directed to be paid to the complainant as compensation under S.357 (1) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 Crl.M.A. 8626 of 2006 was filed initially by the petitioner with a prayer that the joint application for composition filed by the petitioner/accused and the respondent/complainant duly counter signed by their respective counsel may be accepted. It was later, by way of abundant caution, that Crl.M.C. 259 of 2007 was also filed by the petitioner/accused with a prayer that the sentence imposed on him may not be enforced in view of the subsequent composition, by invoking the powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 19734. Writ Petition No.34540 of 2006 is filed by the petitioner therein, who is also an accused in a prosecution under S.138 of theNegotiable Instruments Act, 1881. He has also been found guilty, convicted and sentenced in a prosecution under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. He faces the sentence of S.I. for a period of one month and to pay a fine of Rs.5, 000/- and in default of payment of fine, to suffer S.I. for another period of 15 days. Out of the fine amount, if realised, an amount of Rs.3, 000/- has been directed to be paid as compensation to the complainant under S.357(1) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 19735. The respondents/complainants are represented before me by their counsel. I am satisfied beyond the semblance of doubt, from the submissions made at the Bar as also from the joint statement reporting composition duly filed by the rival contestants and counter signed by their counsel, that the matter has been amicably settled between the parties. Thus the composition, I am satisfied, if legally permissible, can be accepted.6. The law relating to composition of offences is essentially available under S.320 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 I extract the same below:\"S. 320. Compounding of offences.--(1) The offences punishable under the sections of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) specified in the first two columns of the Table next following may be compounded by the persons mentioned in the third column of that Table:.(Table)(2) The offences punishable under the sections of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), specified in the first two columns of the Table next following may, with the permission of the Court before which any prosecution for such offence is pending, be compounded by the persons mentioned in the third column of that Table:-(Table)(3) When any offence is compoundable under this section, the abetment of such offence or an attempt to commit such offence (when such attempt is itself an offence) may be compounded in like manner.(4)(a) When the person who would otherwise be competent to compound an offence under this section is under the age of eighteen years or is an idiot or a lunatic, any person competent to contract on his behalf may, with the permission of the Court, compound such offence.(b) When the person who would otherwise be competent to compound an offence under this section is dead, the legal representative, as defined in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) of such person may, with the consent of the Court, compound such offence.(5) When the accused has been committed for trial or when he has been convicted and an appeal is pending, no composition for the offence shall be allowed without the leave of the court to which he is committed, or. as the case may be. before which the appeal is to be heard.(6) A High Court or Court of Session acting in the exercise of its powers of revision under S.401 may allow any person to compound any offence which such person is competent to compound under this section.(7) No offence shall be compounded if the accused is, by reason of a previous conviction, liable either to enhanced punishment or to a punishment of a different kind for such offence.(8) The composition of an offence under this section shall have the effect of an acquittal of the accused with whom the offence has been compounded.(9) No offence shall be compounded except as provided by this section.\"The language of S.320 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 indicates that the said section will apply only to offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code and not to any offence punishable under any special law.7. S.320 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 does not, hence apply specifically to S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. All crimes are offences against the State and unless the law declares the offences to be compoundable, they cannot be permitted to be compounded. Such offences against the State cannot be compounded by the aggrieved private individual unless the law declares such offences to be compoundable. Realising this difficulty, S. 147 was brought into the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 by the subsequent amendment in 2002 and the newly introduced S.147, which I extract below, declares that the offence under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 shall be compoundable.\"S. 147. Offences to be compoundable. -- Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure. 1973 (2 of 1974), every offence punishable under this Act shall be compoundable.\" (emphasis supplied)8. The first contention that is raised is that S.320 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 cannot apply at all to an offence under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 because S.147 opens with the words \"Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973\". But, according to me, it would be irrational and unreasonable to so understand the non obstante clause in S.147, because if such interpretation were accepted, there will be no other stipulated procedure under which the composition of the offence under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 as permitted under S.147 can be implemented. The non obstante clause in S.147 must hence be read reasonably as to mean that the offence under S.138 will be compoundable under S.320 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973, notwithstanding the fact that S.320 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 does not in terms apply to S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and applies only to offences under the Indian Penal Code specified under S.320(1) and (2).9. When composition can be legally accepted, it is necessary that there must be a procedure prescribed. The stipulation for deemed acquittal after composition must also be there, as otherwise it will be impossible to work out the consequences of a composition. In this context Ss.4 and 5 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 assume relevance. I extract them below:\"S.4. Trial of offences under the Indian Penal Code and other laws.-(1) AH offences under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) shall be investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions hereinafter contained.(2) All offences under any other law shall be investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to the same provisions, but subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or place of investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with such offences.5. Saving. - Nothing contained in this Code shall, in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary, affect any special or local law for the time being in force, or any special jurisdiction or power conferred, or any special form of procedure prescribed, by any other law for the time being in force.\"10. When no special procedure is prescribed under any special law, the procedure prescribed under the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 has to be followed for investigation, enquiry, trial or otherwise dealing with such situations. If there is a specific provision contra in any such special law the provisions of the Code shall not apply. About the procedure for composition and its consequences we have stipulations in the Code. There is no provision in the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 also. Therefore, S.4 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 must apply and S.5 cannot apply while considering the procedure to be followed for effecting a composition of the offence under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 as permitted under S.147 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Any different understanding of the non obstante clause in S.147 will leave the courts without any known or specified procedure to be followed while considering the acceptance of the composition. The non obstante clause in S.147 means only this i.e.\"an offence under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 may not be compoundable under S.320 of the Code. That provision as it stands may apply only to specified offences under the Indian Penal Code, 1860. But it is stipulated hereby that the offence under S. 138 shall also be reckoned as a compoundable offence under the Code i.e. under S.320 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973\"I respectfully disagree with the different view taken by the Gujarat High Court in Kirpalsingh Pratapsingh Ors. v. Balvinder Kaur Hardipsingh Lobana (2004 Crl.L.J. 3786)2004 CrLJ 3786.11. In as much as S.147 only declares the offence to be compoundable, it will necessarily have to be assumed that the composition will fall under S.320(1) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and not under S.320(2) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 Composition can be effected even without the permission of the court. That is the only way to understand S. 147 from the plain language employed by S.147 of the Act. I therefore, come to the conclusion that S.147 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and S.320 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 read along with Ss.4 and 5 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 can lead only to the conclusion that the offence under S.138 is compoundable without the permission of the Court and in the event of such composition, the procedure under S.320 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 has got to be followed.12. That takes me to the next question as to when the composition of an offence, to which S.320(1) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 applies, can be effected. After the offence is committed, there must be a gap of time between such commission of the offence and cognizance of the offence by the Court. After cognizance, till the trial court pronounces the judgment, there is a gap of time. Thereafter, during the pendency of the appeal and revision also there must be gaps of time. After the conviction and sentence become final the last stage arises and that may be prior to execution of the sentence or during execution of sentence.13. The contention that an offence can be compounded under S.320(1) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 only when the matter is pending before a court has been considered by me. But that does not appear to me to be the correct law. The decisions in Mrs. EM. Torpey v. King Emperor (AIR 1927 Allahabad 375)1927 AIR(All) 375 and Kumaraswami Chetty v. Kuppuswami Chetty (1918) 41 Mad.685) clearly show that initiation of proceedings/prosecution is not a condition precedent for composition of the offence. In short, composition can be effected even prior to commencement of prosecution. In Mrs. Torpey (supra) the question is dealt with by the learned Judge in the following words, after referring to the decision in Kumaraswami Chetty (supra).\"The lower appellate Court refused to accept the compromise on the ground that the complaint was filed subsequent to the alleged compromise and not prior thereto. An offence under S .341 may be compounded without the permission of the Court under S. 345(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It, therefore, does not seem to be necessary that a composition should be arrived at after a complaint has been filed in Court. The words of the section are:The offence punishable under the sections of the Indian Penal Code specified in the first column of the table next following may be compounded by the persons mentioned in the third column of that table.An offence of wrongful restraint is compoundable by the person restrained. This appears to be the view suggested by the working of the section and is supported by a Bench ruling of the Madras High Court in the case of Kumaraswami Chetty v. Kuppuswami Chetty. The learned Judges there observed:An offence is complete when the acts constituting it have been committed apart from whether any complaint or charge has been laid before the Court or not. The allusion to the \"accused\" in paragraph 6 of S.345 only describes his character at the time of the trial when the question of the effect of the composition is under consideration.I hold that there can be a composition of the present offence prior to a complaint.\"I do completely concur with that view. That view does appear to me to be most reasonable. If a different view were taken, pending investigation into a compoundable (320 (1) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973) offence which is cognizable and non-bailable, the accused will be forced to endure the trauma of arrest and all the paraphernalia of investigation, till a final report is filed in court, whereupon only he will be able to come to Court and seek composition. If the offence is compoundable under S.320(1) and the parties have compounded the offence, the police must be bound to accept the same and drop further action and make report of the same to the Magistrate concerned. If the police do not, it must be possible for the parties to approach the learned Magistrate or this Court under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 I therefore agree that composition of an offence under S.320(1) can be effected even before cognizance of the offence is taken by the Magistrate.14. Composition pending trial, appeal and revision is perfectly possible and the language of S.320(5) and (6) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 make the position crystal clear. The obvious purpose and the rationale underlying S.320(5) and (6), it appears to me, is only that during the pendency of the proceedings composition of even an offence under S.320(1) should not be arrived at without the knowledge of the Court before which such proceedings are pending. S.320(5) and (6) are applicable to an offence falling within the sweep of S.320(1) also and the purpose can only be to apprise the court of such composition. There is nothing in S.320, which makes a post-revision composition impermissible if the offence would fall within S.320(1) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 S.320(5) and (6) speak of the event of conviction and pendency of an appeal or revision and they do not deal with the liberty or option of the parties to compound the offence after trial/appeal/ revision. By the same reasons given in Mrs.Torpey, it must hence be possible for the parties to enter into a composition even after the verdict of guilty, conviction and sentence have become final and no proceedings are pending before any Court. Going by the plain language of S.320(1), no time limit appears to have been fixed before which the composition must necessarily take place, though for composition during the pendency of appellate or revisional proceedings leave of the Court must be sought under S.320(5) and 320(6).15. But then, such a conclusion also creates further problems. If the verdict of guilty, conviction and sentence have become final, which Court would accept the same so as to avoid execution of the sentence, which has become final. If the trial/ appeal/revision is already over, such original, trial and revisional court would become functus officio and they will not have jurisdiction to alter their verdicts and to convert the verdict of guilty and conviction to a deemed acquittal under S.320(8). The language of S.362 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 which I extract below, makes the position clear.\"S.362. Court not to alter judgment. - Save as otherwise provided by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force, no Court, when it has signed its judgment or final order disposing of a case, shall alter or review the same except to correct a clerical or arithmetical error.\"Therefore the judgment, which has already been rendered, cannot be altered by the trial court, appellate court or the revisional court. The decision in State of Kerala v. MM. Manikantan Nair (2001(3) KLT 802001 (3) KLT 802001 ILO SC 20155 (SC) = AIR 2001 SC 2145)2001 AIR(SC) 21452001 ILO SC 20155 is clear authority for the proposition that a Court, which has become functus officio, cannot thereafter pass any orders in such a case. I extract para 7 of the said judgment for this proposition:\"This Court in Hari Singh Mann v. Harbhajan Singh Bajwa ((2001) 1 SCC 169)2001 (1) SCC 1692000 ILO SC 2803= (2000 AIR SCW 3848)2000 AIR(SCW) 38482000 ILO SC 2803 = AIR 2001 SC 432001 AIR(SC) 432000 ILO SC 2803: 2001 Cri.LJ 128)2001 CrLJ 128, held that S.362 of the Criminal Procedure Code mandates that no Court when it has signed its judgment or final order disposing of a case shall alter or review the same except to correct a clerical or an arithmetical error and that this section is based on an acknowledged principle of law that once a matter is finally disposed of by aCourt. the said Court in the absence of a specific statutory provision becomes functus officio and disentitled to entertain a fresh prayer for the same relief unless the former order of final disposal is set aside by the Court of competent jurisdiction.\" (emphasis supplied)Therefore, it is evident that a trial, appellate or revisional Court, which has become functus officio cannot accept a subsequent composition and alter its own earlier judgment and convert the same to a deemed acquittal under S.320(8) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 It is unnecessary to refer to other precedents. Binding precedents of the Supreme Court make it clear that a Court -- Original, appellate or revisional, which has finally disposed of the matter cannot thereafter exercise any such powers which it could have invoked and exercised prior to such final disposal.16. If the trial, appellate and revisional court cannot do the same and the composition is legally permissible, the question necessarily will have to be considered as to which court can and in what manner the accused, the offence against whom has been compounded in accordance with law, can be saved from the trauma of suffering the sentence.17. It is here that the next question arises as to whether powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 can be invoked by this Court to give effect to such a composition which has been legally arrived at, but for the acceptance of which, there is no specific stipulation of law. S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 reads as follows:-\"S. 482. Saving of inherent powers of High Court.- Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under this Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.\"18. Precedents galore to indicate the sweep, width and amplitude of the inherent powers of this Court under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 S.482 does not really confer any power on the High Court exercising criminal jurisdiction. It only saves the inherent powers of the High Court, which was always there. Ex debito justitiae such power can be invoked and such powers were always available with the court. The width and amplitude of such powers must necessarily instill in the mind of the Court the need to be circumspect. But such powers are not fettered by any stipulations of the Code. If there be any doubt on this proposition, it will be apposite to refer to the decision in Raj Kapoor v. State ((1980) 1 SCC 43)1980 (1) SCC 431979 ILO SC 85. Justice Krishna Iyer in paragraph 10 of that decision refers to the powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 in the following words:\"10. The first question is as to whether the inherent power of the High Court under S.482 stand repelled when the revisional power under S.397 overlaps. The opening words of S.482 contradict this contention because nothing of the Code, not even S.397. can affect the amplitude of the inherent power preserved in so many terms by the language of S.482. Even so. a general principle pervades this branch of law when a specific provision is made: easy resort to inherent power is not right except under compelling circumstances. Not that there is absence of jurisdiction but that inherent power should not invade areas set apart for specific power under the same Code.\" (emphasis supplied)19. Later, the Supreme Court had occasion to specifically consider whether the stipulations under S.320 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 would fetter the powers of the High Court under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 The decision in B.S. Joshi v. State of Haryana (AIR 2003 SC 1386)2003 AIR(SC) 13862003 ILO SC 230 makes the position clear and the Supreme Court speaks thus through Justice Y.K.Sabharwal in paragraphs 8 and 15:\"8. It is, thus, clear that Madhu Limaye 's case does not lay down any general proposition limiting power of quashing the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint as vested in S.482 of the Code or extraordinary power under Art.226 of the Constitution Of India, 1950. We are, therefore, of the view that if for the purpose of securing the ends of justice, quashing of FIR becomes necessary. S.320 would not be abar to the exercise of power of quashing, it is however, a different matter depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case whether to exercise or not such a power.\"\" 15. In view of the above discussion, we hold that in the High Court in exercise of its inherent powers can quash criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint and S.320of the Code does not limit or affect the powers under S. 482 of the Code.\" ' (emphasis supplied)These observations were made while considering the question of quashing an F.I.R. But there is nothing to show that the principle will not apply when the question of quashing a sentence which has become final is considered when the offence is legally compounded.20. A Full Bench of this Court had looked at the sweep of the powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973, though in a different context, and the rationale underlying in S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is expressed by the Full Bench in the following words in Moosa v. Sub Inspector of Police (2006 (1) KLT 552)2006 (1) KLT 552:\"No legislative enactment dealing with procedure can provide for all cases that may possibly arise. Courts, therefore, have inherent powers apart from express provisions of law which are necessary for proper discharge of functions and duties imposed upon them by law. In exercise of the powers court would be justified to quash any proceedings if it finds that initiation or continuance of it amounts to abuse of the process of court or quashing of these proceedings would otherwise serve the ends of justice.\" (emphasis supplied)21. Having so understood the sweep of the powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973, I need only mention that the powers under Art.226/227 of the Constitution Of India, 1950 are co-extensive if not wider in its sweep. The powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 as also Art.226 and 227 of the Constitution Of India, 1950 are available with the Court to do justice in a given case when the conscience of the Court is satisfied that powers must be invoked.22. It will be apposite to straight away look at S.320 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 again. S.320 does not specifically refer to composition prior to the commencement of the prosecution or of composition after the sentence has become final. S.320, which must be reckoned as consolidating the law relating to composition, does not specifically refer to pre-cognizance and post-finality (of conviction) compositions. S.320(9) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 only says that there shall be no composition except in accordance with the provisions of S.320 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 In as much as S.320 does not specifically refer to compositions - pre-cognizance or post-finality, and S.320(1) only speaks of composition without any fetters or limitations about time and stage, S.320(9) cannot be held to fetter the powers in such situations.23. The rationale underlying S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is that the interests of justice may at times transcend the interests of mere law. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of a given case when the High Court considers it necessary, proper and fit and feels impelled and compelled to act in aid of justice, it should not be without powers and helpless. While appreciating the width and amplitude of the powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 this principle cannot be lost sight of. Of course if there is a specific express bar or if the stipulations point to an implied bar, such powers cannot normally be invoked.24. We now come to the crucial question as to whether this court, having already disposed of the revisions, can invoke the powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 The revision has been disposed of and the verdict of guilty, conviction and sentence have now become final. I have come across decisions which stipulate that in view of S.362, even this Court exercising original power as a criminal court under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973, cannot go against the mandate of S.362. The decision in Smt. Sooraj Devi v. Pyare Lal & Anr. ((1981) 1 SCC 500)1981 (1) SCC 5001981 ILO SC 135 clearly holds that after the judgment is pronounced, on the same facts powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 cannot be invoked in view of the specific bar under S.362. This position has been held repeatedly. In Hari Singh Mann v. Harbhajan Singh Bajwa (AIR 2001 SC 432001 AIR(SC) 432000 ILO SC 2803), it was held by the Supreme Court as follows in paragraphs 8 and 9:\"8.The practice of filing miscellaneous petitions after the disposal of the main case and issuance of fresh directions in such miscellaneous petitions by the High Court are unwarranted, not referable to any statutory provision and in substance the abuse of the process of the Court.9. There is no provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure authorising the High Court to review the judgment passed either in exercise of its appellate or revisional or original criminal jurisdiction. Such power cannot be exercised with the aid or under the cloak of S.482 of the Code.\"In State of Kerala v. MM. Manikantan Nair (2001 (3) KLT 802001 (3) KLT 802001 ILO SC 20155 (SC) = MR 2001 SC 2145) the Supreme Court held so in paragraph 6:\"6. The Code of Criminal Procedure does not authorise the High Court to review its judgment or order passed either in exercise of its appellate, revisional or original jurisdiction. S.362 of the Code prohibits the Court after it has signed its judgment or final order disposing a case from altering orreviewing the saidjudgment or order except to correct a clerical or arithmetical error. This prohibition is complete and no criminal Court can review its own judgment or order after it is signed.\"In Moti Lal v. State of Madhya Pradesh (AIR 1994 SC 1544)1994 AIR(SC) 15441993 ILO SC 116 the Supreme Court held so in paragraph 2:\"2. S.362 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 in clear terms lays down that the Court cannot alter judgment after the same has been signed except to correct clerical or arithmetical errors. That being the position the High Court had no jurisdiction under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to alter the earlier judgment.\"In Damodaran v. State (1992 (2) KLT 165)1992 (2) KLT 165 and in Tanveer Aquil v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1990 Suppl. SCC 63)1990 (S) SCC 631989 ILO SC 361 we find observations which suggest that a post revision composition cannot be readily accepted. Those decisions, according to me, only reiterate the principle that a trial, appellate or revisional court which is functus officio in respect of a subject matter cannot thereafter exercise powers in respect of such disposed of matters in view of S.362 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 197325. But these decisions cannot be held to cover a situation when post-revision there has been a substantial change in the circumstances and a later request is made in a separate application under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or Art.226 of 227 of the Constitution Of India, 1950. That question was specifically considered by the Supreme Court in Mostt. Simrikhia v. Smt. Dolley Mukherjee (1990 Crl.L.J. 1599)1990 CrLJ 1599. In paragraph 2 of the said decision, the Supreme Court has observed thus:\"If there had been change in the circumstances of the case, it would be in order for the High Court to exercise its inherent powers in the prevailing circumstances and pass appropriate orders to secure the ends of justice or to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court. Where there is no such changed circumstances and the decision has to be arrived at on the facts that existed as on the date of the earlier order, the exercise of the power to reconsider the same materials to arrive at different conclusion is in effect a review, which is expressly barred under S.362.\"26. In the instant cases, when the revision petition was disposed of by this Court, this circumstance - that the parties settled the dispute and the complainant compounded the offence - was not there at all. It is a subsequent change in circumstance. The decision in Mostt. Simrikhia (supra) squarely applies. That was a case where an earlier application under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 was dismissed, but still the Supreme Court held that a change in circumstances is sufficient to justify the invocation of the powers afresh under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 notwithstanding the bar under S.362 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 In the instant case, the powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 have not been sought to be invoked earlier. Only the revisional powers were exercised. That is all the more the reason why under the changed circumstances the extra ordinary inherent jurisdiction under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 can be invoked. In the light of the dictum in Mostt. Simrikhia earlier decisions rendered and subsequent decisions, which do not refer to the said decision specifically and in which the opinion is expressed that the powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 cannot be invoked after disposal of the revision in view of the bar under S.362, cannot be held to lay down the law correctly.27. Lastly, the question arises whether, in the facts and circumstances of this case, such power can or need be invoked. The prosecution is under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Basically the crux of the offence is the inability of a person to make payment of the amount due under the cheque within the stipulated period of time when demand is made on the basis of a dishonoured cheque. Virtually culpability lies in the failure to discharge a financial liability. One cannot lose sight of the fact that essentially and basically it is the failure to pay the amount within the stipulated time even after notice of demand is received, which is made punishable under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. In such a case conscience of the court would be hurt if in spite of composition the accused were to be compelled to undergo a substantive sentence of incarceration in prison. The prison sentence is frightening for the polity. The polity abhors it. Unless absolutely necessary, such deprivation of liberty should not be resorted to. These circumstances also must weigh with the court while considering the question whether powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 can and ought to be invoked in cases like the instant ones.28. Having rendered my very anxious consideration to all the relevant inputs, I am satisfied that these are eminently fit instances where powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 can and ought to be invoked in favour of the petitioners herein, who have settled their disputes with the respective complainants and have made payment of the amounts payable to the respective complainants/payees under the cheques in question. To direct the parties to go to the Supreme Court to get the composition accepted or to knock at the door of the Government for invocation of the powers under Sections 432 or 433 to avoid incarceration in prison would be heartless and would amount to unjustified abdication of the jurisdiction under S.482, I feel.29. Will not such invocation of the powers militate against the majesty of law and the finality of decisions rendered? If composition can be reached at any time after the conviction and sentence have become final, what respect can decisions of the Courts command? These questions do disturb me. But in the final analysis they do not persuade me to hold differently. The offence is compoundable. Parties have settled their disputes amicably. Complainants have voluntarily compounded the offence. There is no specific bar against such composition after the finality of the conviction and sentence. The offence is only one under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. If the powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 were not invoked by this Court, the petitioners will have to necessarily undergo the dreadful ordeal of punitive incarceration in prison. By being humane and considerate towards such an accused who has made amends and reversed his culpable conduct, the majesty of the law will not suffer at all. Quality of mercy is the most important dimension of justice. I hold that these are fit cases to invoke the powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 197330. I may hasten to observe that I do not intend to lay down a rule of the thumb that there can be post revision composition as a matter of routine. Facts in each case will have to be considered carefully. That the petitioners shall have to undergo punitive substantive sentence of imprisonment in prison in these cases, under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 does perhaps persuade me in the final analysis to invoke such powers.31. In both these cases, I find that an amount of Rs.2, 000/- is to be paid to the State as fine and in these circumstances the powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 can be invoked only subject to the condition that such amounts must be paid to the State by the respective petitioners. Such a stipulation shall ensure the interests of justice eminently.3.2. To sum up, I take the view that in a case falling under S.320(1) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 where there has been a post revision composition of the offence by the victim/complainant, the jurisdiction under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (and of course Article 226/227 of the Constitution Of India, 1950) is in law available with the High Court and in a fit case such powers can and ought to be invoked. The cases on hand are emineatly fit cases where such jurisdiction ought to be invoked, I conclude.33. In the result, W.P. (C) 34540 of 2006 and Crl. M.C. 259 of 2007 are allowed. It is directed that the sentences imposed on the petitioners shall not be executed on condition that the petitioners deposit an amount of Rs. 2000/- each before the learned Magistrates concerned within a period of 45 days from this date. In default of payment of the said amount of Rs. 2000/- each, they shall undergo the default sentences approved in the respective orders in revision.34. Crl. M.A.No. 8626 of 2006 in Crl.R.P.No.7 of 2004 is dismissed as unnecessary in view of the order in Crl. M.C. 259 of 2007.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Order of the Court was as follows :1. The revision petitioner was convicted and sentenced by the Magistrate court to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of 5 months for offence under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short 'the Act')- The revision petitioner-accused was also directed to pay a sum of Rs. 1, 50, 000/- as compensation under S.357(3) of Cr.P.C. and in default to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of 2 months.2. In appeal, the conviction was confirmed by the Sessions Court but the sentence of 5 months was modified to simple imprisonment till rising of the court. The compensation was confirmed. The said conviction and sentence are challenged by the accused in Cr.R.P.No.4487 of 2006. The complainant filed a revision (Crl.R.P.3275/06) challenging the illegality of the sentence passed. Both these revisions are heard together and disposed of by this common judgment.3. Facts briefly: (The parties will be referred to as complainant and accused, for convenience sake). The accused allegedly gave Ext.P1 cheque in discharge of a debt/liability which he owed towards the complainant. The cheque, on presentation, was dishonoured on the ground of insufficiency of fund. A notice was sent demanding payment but no payment was made. He, however, sent a reply notice. After complying with the legal requirements, complaint was filed alleging that the accused committed offence under S. 138 of the Act.4. Evidence was adduced on both sides. The accused set up a case that he is a contractor and that he used to supply materials in a lorry owned by the complainant between the period 14.3.2000 to 24.6.2000. Asa security, he had entrusted a blank cheque with the complainant. Though the liability was settled, as evidenced by Ext.DI and D1 (a), the cheque was not returned, inspite of requests. Therefore, a stop memo was issued to the bank by the petitioner. He also gave a criminal complaint against the complainant which was taken on file as C.M.P.281/01 (Exts.D2 and D3). The accused does not owe any money to the complainant, but the blank cheque was misused by the complainant to foist a false case against him.5. The Courts below, after consideration of the defence case found that it cannot be accepted. It was also held that, since the accused's case is not acceptable, the complainant's case is more probable. It was also held by learned Magistrate: \"when the execution and issuance of Ext.P1 cheque stands proved, complainant is entitled to get the benefit of presumption as envisaged under S.139 of the N.I. Act. By applying that presumption it can be seen that, Ext.P1 cheque was issued by the accused for discharging his legally enforceable liability towards the complainant.\" The lower appellate court concurred with the above findings and held that the Magistrate has \"has appreciated the evidence in the correct perspective there is no reason to interfere with the conviction passed by the lower court\"6. After hearing both sides and on perusal of the records in this case, particularly judgments of the court below, I find that the courts below committed a serious illegality in finding that the prosecution case is more probable because the accused's version is not acceptable. In any criminal case, what the court has to primarily consider is whether prosecution has proved its case or not .The court is bound to look into all the materials available and both oral and documentary evidence adduced in the case and enter a finding whether all the ingredients of the offence are proved by the prosecution or not.7. But, both the courts below analysed only the defence version and came to the conclusion that the accused failed to establish his case and hence, it was concluded that complainant's case is more probable. It is needless to say that the probability of the prosecution case does not depend upon the improbability or falsity of the defence case. It may not be proper to enter a finding that the prosecution case is true only because the defence case is untrue. Irrespective of the falsity or improbability of the defence case, the prosecution has to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. What the court has to consider is whether the prosecution has proved all the ingredients of the offence or not and not whether the accused has failed to establish his case to come to a conclusion whether prosecution has established its case.8. The failure on the part of the accused to establish his case will not automatically be a ground to hold that the prosecution has proved its case. Even the silence on the part of the accused cannot be made a ground to conclude that the prosecution succeeded in establishing its case, particularly, without examining the evidence adduced by the prosecution. In this direction, both the courts committed a clear illegality in violating all the well-settled principles of criminal law, and appreciation of evidence. Even the provisions contained in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 are ignored. Under S. 101 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the burden is on the prosecution to prove its case and such burden is not discharged by showing that the accused's case is improbable or false.9. In a case involving offence under S. 138 of the Act, the court shall first consider, on the basis of the evidence all materials placed before court, whether the prosecution has proved that the cheque is drawn by the accused. In considering this question, it may be necessary to refer to the evidence adduced by the accused also, depending upon facts and circumstances of each case. But that does not mean that the burden shifts to the accused to prove that the cheque was not-drawn by him. If the prosecution proves that the cheque was drawn by the accused, the court has to further consider whether such drawing was for the purpose of the discharge of any debt or liability. These two ingredients of the offence of S.138 of the Act are inevitable factors to be established in a criminal prosecution for offence under S. 138 of the Act. But both the courts below did not even look into the evidence of PW1 to come to the conclusion whether his evidence at least refers to the fact that the cheque was drawn by the accused. On going through the evidence of PW1, the complaint and the chief affidavit, I find that there is no evidence to show that the cheque was \"drawn\" by the accused.10. The expression \"drawing\" is not defined under the Act but the \"drawer\" is defined under S. 7 of the Act. The \"drawer\" is defined as the person who \"makes\" the cheque. \"Make' means 'prepare, create' etc. Therefore, the court has to consider whether there is evidence to show that the accused has \"made\" the cheque. That is, whether he has created or prepared the cheque. To prepare the cheque, he can certainly take the aid of another person to fill up the relevant details in the cheque especially if he is illiterate or if he is unable to prepare the same for some reason or due to any other justifiable reason. Thus, he may either prepare or create the cheque by himself or cause the relevant details in the cheque to be filled up by another person under his instructions. But, the cheque shall be signed by the drawer himself.11. An instrument can be construed as a \"cheque\" only if such document satisfies the requirements under S. 5 read with S.6 of the Act. A cheque has to be a bill of exchange which has to contain an order in writing and it shall be signed by the accused. The cheque thus, mainly consists of two parts: (1) the order in writing and (2) the signature of the drawer. A cheque which contains only the signature cannot be construed as a \"cheque\", though it is loosely referred to as a \"cheque\". In law, it is only a blank cheque-leaf which contains the signature. So, on the facts and circumstances of each case, the court will have to examine whether the instrument involved is \"cheque\" as defined under S. 5 read with S.6 of the Act or whether it was only a \"blank cheque ieaf\" containing the signature alone. Depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case, the court will have to decide whether it was only a blank cheque leaf, with or without the order in writing that was handed over to the complainant or some other person.12. But, a reading of the first paragraph of the complaint and the chief affidavit will go to show that the only allegation made in the compliant regarding drawing of the cheque is that \"the cheque was written for an amount of Rs. 1, 45, 000/- with date 31.7.2001\". There is no other averment that the payee's name was entered while the so called cheque was handed over to complainant. Under what circumstances, the payee's name happened to be entered in Exhibit P1 is not in evidence. Neither in the complaint nor in the evidence of PW1, the complainant stated whether there was any direction in the cheque handed over to him that Rs. 1, 45, 000/- was to be paid to him. This omission in the evidence itself is enough to hold that the complainant failed to prove that the cheque was \"drawn\" by the accused as contemplated by the provisions in Sections 5 and 6 of the Act especially in the light of the specific contention raised by the accused that he had entrusted only a blank cheque.13. The mere production of the cheque. Exhibit P1 does not prove by itself that the contents were either prepared by the accused or caused to be prepared by him. This is specially so, since the complainant only stated that the amount and date were written in the cheque and he omitted to state other details. It is only if the court is satisfied that a cheque was created or made as referred to in S. 5 read with S. 6 containing an order in writing that the court can hold that the cheque is drawn by the accused. A mere signature in the cheque or a writing of the amount or date in the cheque will not be sufficient for the court to conclude that the cheque is drawn by the accused in favour of the complainant.13A. No amount of discussion on the defence evidence, the flaws and latches on the part of the accused will make good, the failure on the part of PW1 to prove that the cheque was drawn by the accused. The mere production of a document will not prove that it was created, made or drawn by the accused. The production of the document will only prove the contents of the document, but not the truth of its contents or the fact it was created or made by the accused. The mere production of the cheque only proves the existence of the document and the fact that it contains certain things, but it will not further prove that the said document was executed by a particular person, in the absence of evidence to that effect. Whether the contents are filled up by the accused or caused to be filled by the accused or whether it is filled up by the complainant or caused to be filled by the complainant under instructions of accused himself or whether it was filled up by the complainant on his own accord without instructions from the accused etc. are matters which may require consideration depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. On the facts of this case, there is no evidence to infer, presume or conclude that the cheque was \"drawn\" by the accused. This is a clear case where the prosecution failed to prove that the accused has drawn a cheque as defined under S. 5 read with S. 6 of the Act.14. On a perusal of the records and evidence, I do not find that this is a fit case where an opportunity is to be given to the complainant to establish his case. The lacuna is not something which can be allowed to be filled up, because such permission will result in miscarriage of justice. The case set up by the accused that he only handed over a blank cheque, to certain extent, has been probabilised by the vital omissions in the compliant and in the evidence of PW1. Both the courts below have not considered whether the cheque was \"drawn\" by the accused as referred to in S. 5 read with S. 6 of the Act and whether there is evidence adduced by the prosecution to prove this fact. The accused is convicted for offence under S.138 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 even in the absence of such a finding. This is clearly illegal.15. Regarding the incurring of debt also, there is absolutely no satisfactory evidence. A bare statement is made in the complaint as well as in the chief examination that the cheque was entrusted for the discharge of an amount of Rs. 1, 45, 000/- which the accused owed to the complainant. None of the details are available before the court to come to the conclusion that such bare allegations are true. The defence has brought out in evidence that there was a transaction between the accused and the complainant and a suggestion made to the complainant that all the amounts which the accused owed to the complainant were paid was not denied by the complainant, while he was cross-examined. It is only in the reexamination that the complainant came forward with a new case that the amount was borrowed by the accused but even at that time it was not stated from where, on what date it was borrowed etc.16. Learned counsel appearing for complainant vehemently contended that as per the dictum laid down in Goa Plast (P) Ltd. v. Chico Ursula D' Sauze (2003 (2) KLT 16 (SC) = (2004) 2 SCC 235) it has to be presumed that the cheque is issued in discharge of any debt or liability. But, the above decision is to be read along with the decision of the three Judges bench of the Supreme Court in HitaI P.Dalai v. Bratindranath Banerjee (2001) 6 SCC 16), wherein it is held that to draw a presumption the court must be satisfied that the basis for drawing the presumption are established. One of the requirements for drawing the presumption is that the \"cheque\" has to be of the nature stated in S. 138. That means, the cheque must be one \"drawn\" by the accused. Since drawing is not established, presumption under S. 139 cannot be drawn as one of the requirements under S. 139 is not proved in this case. All these aspects were considered in detailed in the decision reported in Kamalammal v. Mohanan (2006 (3) KLT 972) and hence, the complainant cannot take the aid of presumption under S. 139 of the Act, in the absence of proving that the cheque was drawn by the accused.17. The court below has committed a grave illegality in holding that there is a presumption in favour of the complainant under S. 139 of the Act, since the execution is proved. Here, execution/drawing of the cheque itself is not proved. The presumption under S. 139 of the N.I. Act can be drawn only in favour of the \"holder\" of the cheque. 'Holder' is defined under S. 8 of the Act. But, the courts below failed to consider whether the complainant is \"holder\" of the cheque. The courts below went wrong in drawing the presumption under S. 139 in favour of the complainant even without considering whether the complainant is the \"holder\" as defined under the Act. As the title to S. 139 itself indicates presumption under the said provision can be drawn only in favour of \"holder\". These facts are discussed in detail in the judgment referred to in Kamalammal v. Mohanan (2006 (3) KLT 972) and Gemini v. Chandran (2007 (2) KLT 439).18. In such circumstances, I find that the conviction and sentence passed against the revision petitioner in Crl.R.P.4487 of 2006 are unsustainable and those are set aside. The accused is found not guilty of offence under S. 138 of the Act and he is acquitted of the said offence. He is set at liberty forthwith.Crl. R.P. 4487 of 2006 is allowed. Crl. R.P. No.3275 of 2006 is dismissed.Petition dismissed"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE K. T. SANKARAN1. The question of law involved in these Criminal Miscellaneous cases is, whether in a complaint under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, filed by a Government Company as defined under S.617 of the Companies Act, 1956 represented by its Development Officer (Law), it is necessary for the Magistrate to examine the complainant under S.200 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or whether Cl.(a) of the first proviso to S.200 would apply to the case.2. Five Criminal Miscellaneous cases are filed by the accused Surendran seeking to quash the proceedings in five cases pending before the Court of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-I, Ernakulam. Other eight Criminal Miscellaneous cases are filed by Rajan, accused in those cases, to quash the proceedings therein, pending before the Courts of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ernakulam, Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thrissur and Courts of Judicial Magistrate of the First Class at Thrissur, Kochi and Emakulam.3. The complaint was filed by the National Small Industries Corporation Limited represented by its Development Officer (Law). It is stated in the complaint that the complainant is a Government Company as defined under S.617 of the Companies Act, 1956. The Company is represented by the Development Officer (Law) who is also the Power of Attorney Holder authorised to file the complaint. It is further stated in the complaint thus:\"The Power of Attorney Holder is a public servant within the ambit of S.21 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Since the complainant is represented by a public servant and he is discharging his official duties, he is exempted from giving sworn statement u/s. 200 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for taking cognizance of the offence.\"4. The contentions raised by Shri T.G. Rajendran and Shri K.S. Madhusoodanan, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in these Criminal Miscellaneous cases is that the learned Magistrate was not justified in taking cognizance of the case and in issuing process to the accused without taking the sworn statement of the complainant and without examining upon oath the complainant under S.200 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. It is also submitted that Cl. (a) to the first proviso to S.200 is not attracted in these cases and therefore, the complainant cannot get immunity from examination upon oath as provided under S.200. Sri.K.P.Dandapani, Sr. Advocate submits that Cl. (a) to the first proviso of S.200 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 would apply in the case.5. For the sake of convenience, S.200 is extracted below:\"200. Examination of complainant:-- A Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence on complaint shall examine upon oath the complainant and the witnesses present, if any, and the substance of such examination shall be reduced to writing and shall be signed by the complainant and the witnesses, and also by the Magistrate:Provided that, when the complaint is made in writing, the Magistrate need not examine the complainant and the witnesses-(a) if a public servant acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duties or a Court has made the complaint; or(b) if the Magistrate makes over the case for inquiry or trial to another Magistrate under S.192.Provided further that if the Magistrate makes over the case to another Magistrate under S. 192 after examining the complainant and the witnesses, the latter Magistrate need not re-examine them.\"6. S.200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was also almost in similar terms. Relevant portion of S.200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 is as follows:\"200. Examination of complainant.-- A Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence on complaint shall at once examine the it and the witnesses present, if any, upon oath and the substance of the examination shall be reduced to writing and shall be signed by the complainant and the witnesses and also by the Magistrate:Provided as follows:(a) When the complaint is made in writing, nothing herein contained shall be deemed to require a Magistrate to examine the complainant before transfering the case under S.192;(aa) when the complaint is made in writing nothing herein contained shall be deemed to require the examination of a complainant in any case in which the complaint has been made by a Court or by a public servant acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duties\".The change brought out in 1973 Code was that the words 'at once' in S.200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 were deleted in the 1973 Code. The proviso under 1898 Code was re-drafted, thereby Cl.(aa) of the proviso to S.200 in the 1898 Code corresponds to the present Cl. (a) of the first proviso to S.200 of the 1973 Code. Of course, except the slight modification in the words, Cl. (aa) of the proviso to S.200 of 1898 Code is substantially the same as Cl. (a) of the first proviso to S.200 of 1973 Code. S.21 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 defines ' Public servant'. The 12th clause is relevant for the purpose of this case, which reads as under:\"21. \"Public Servant\":-- The words 'public servant' denote a person falling under any of the descriptions hereinafter following, namely:-Twelfth:- Every person-(a) in the service or pay of the Government or remunerated by fees or commission for the performance of any public duty by the Government;(b) in the service or pay of a local authority, a corporation established by or under a Central, Provincial or State Act or a Government Company as defined in S.617 of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956).\"7. In Krishna Warrier v. Velunny (1960 KLT 5881960 KLT 588), the scope and ambit of Cl. (aa) of the proviso to S.200 of 1898 Code came up for consideration. In that case, the District Magistrate who was appointed as Commissioner of Enquiry under S. 10 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 preferred a complaint, acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duties. The question arose, whether his examination under S.200 was necessary or whether Cl.(aa) of the proviso to S.200 was applicable. It was not disputed that the complainant was a public servant. However, this court held that the complainant had no official duty whatever to prefer a complaint and therefore his examination was necessary. It was held thus:\"In my view, S. 10 of the Act also cannot avail the complainant, for the reason, that assuming as Commissioner of Inquiry, he was a public servant, it was not part of his duty to prefer the complaint. I cannot also accept the view taken by the learned Judge below, that by the mere order of Government authorising the complainant to prefer the complaint, he could be deemed to be acting in the discharge of his official duty, because the Government Order did not confer any power on him to be exercised by him as an official, save that of preferring the complaint. On the basis, that he had no official duty whatever to prefer a complaint, as the District Magistrate or as the Commissioner of Inquiry, it is \" difficult to hold, that he purported to act in the discharge of official duty; he could not be deemed to have acted, in either of the two capacities\".8. The decision in Krishna Warrier v. Velunny (1960 KLT 5881960 KLT 588), was followed by Patna High Court in Ramashray Singh v. Anand Mohan (1977 Crl. L.J. 1024)1977 CrLJ 1024. In that case, the complaint was filed by a Civil Assistant Surgeon against an Advocate. The learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offence. The complainant was not examined. Summons was issued to the accused, which was sought to be quashed in the Criminal Miscellaneous case filed before the High Court. It was held by the Patna High Court thus:\"The proviso to S. 200 of the Code makes it clear that in making the complaint the complainant must be acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duties. In other words, the law or his duties should enjoin upon him to make the complaint. S. 195 of the Code lays down the circumstances when a complaint by a public servant has to be filed before cognizance of the particular offence can be taken. When the law does not enjoin a duty on the public servant to make complaint and the public servant makes a complaint, he does not do so in discharge or in purported discharge of his official duty. I am satisfied that in the instant case the law did not enjoin any duty upon thedoctor to make a complaint even though he might have been obstructed in the discharge of his official duty when the occurrence had taken place. Therefore, it was essential for the Sub Divisional Magistrate to examine the complainant on solemn affirmation before he proceeded further in the case.\"9. In 1976 CrLL.J. 3701976 CrLJ 370(N.B. Mukherjee v. State of West Bengal), the Calcutta High Court held that in a complaint filed by a Public Prosecutor in Special Court, process against the accused cannot be issued without examining the Public Prosecutor under S.200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and that cl.(aa) of the proviso to S.200 would not apply. In Manidra Nath v. Public Prosecutor (1919 Crl. L.J. 14651919 CrLJ 1465), the Public Prosecutor filed a petition of complaint against the accused persons for offence under the Arms Act, 1959. The question arose, whether the complainant should be examined before issuing process. It was held thus:\"But it must be noticed that it is not sufficient that the complainant should be a public servant to exempt him from examination under S.200(aa) but he must file a complaint in the discharge of his duties. It is not part of the duty of the learned Public Prosecutor as learned Public Prosecutor to file a complaint and when he does that, his position is that of a private complainant and, therefore, he should have been examined u/s. 200 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973.\"10. I respectfully follow the decision in 1960 KLT 588 and the decisions of the Calcutta High Court in N.B. Mukherjee v. State of West Bengal (1976 Crl. L.J. 370)1976 CrLJ 370, and 1979 Crl.L.J. 1465 and that of the Patna High Court in Ramashray Singh v. AnandMohan (1977 Crl. L.J. 1024)1977 CrLJ 1024referred to above. It is true that the Power of Attorney Holder who filed the complaint on behalf of the complainant-company, is a public servant. He was acting as per the directions issued and he was also authorised to file the complaint by the company. As per the averments in the complaint, the question is whether he was acting in discharge of his official duties in the matter of filing the complaint. It is not sufficient that the person concerned is a public servant and that he was acting in discharge of his official duties. His official duties must also include preferring complaints in accordance with the provisions of law by which he is empowered to file complaints. In the case on hand, the Power of Attorney Holder of the company has no official duty to file the complaint. In other words, he is not empowered under any law to prefer complaints in discharge of his official duties. Therefore, it cannot be said that Cl.(a) of the first proviso to S.200 would apply, thereby exempting him from examination upon oath as provided under S.200 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. I am of the view that the learned Magistrate has committed an error in issuing process to the accused before examining the complainant upon oath and before the substance of such examination is reduced to writing and signed by the complainant.11. Learned counsel Shri T.G Rajendran contended that cognizance taken in the case was illegal and therefore all the proceedings are liable to be quashed. He also submitted that if fresh cognizance is to be taken, the complaint would be barred by limitation. I am not inclined to agree with the submission of the counsel. Taking cognizance means that the Magistrate, after applying his mind to the contents of the complaint, decides to proceed further in accordance with the provisions of Chap. XV of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Before recording statement of the complainant cognizance could be taken. A Full Bench of this Court in Asokan v. State of Kerala (2005 (3) KLT7702005 (3) KLT 770 (KB.)) considered the question whether examination of witnesses under S.200 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is at the pre-cognizance stage or at the post-cognizance stage. The Full Bench held thus:\"The argument of the learned Public Prosecutor that the examination of witnesses under Ss. 200 and 202 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is at the pre-cognizance stage stems from a misconception of the law. There is indeed a popular misconception that a Magistrate is supposed to take cognizance only when he actually records the sworn statement of the complainant and his witnesses if any, and issues process to the accused. The correct legal position is that when a Magistrate on receiving a complaint applies his mind and decides to proceed under the various provisions such as Ss. 200 or 202 of Chap. XV Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the Magistrate must be held to have taken cognizance of the offence mentioned in the complaint. If, however, the Magistrate, instead of proceeding under Chap.XV Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973, decides to forward the complaint to the police for investigation under S. 156(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or issues a search warrant for the purpose of investigation, he cannot be said to have taken cognizance of any offence. (See R.R. Chart v. State of U.P. (AIR 1951 SC 207)1951 AIR(SC) 2071951 ILO SC 84, Gopal Das Sindhi v. State of Assam & Anr. (AIR 1961 SC 986)1961 AIR(SC) 9861961 ILO SC 527, Jamuna Singh v. Bhadaj Shah (AIR 1964 SC 1541)1964 AIR(SC) 15411963 ILO SC 129and Laxminarayana v. Narayana (AIR 1976 SC 1672)1976 AIR(SC) 16721976 ILO SC 591. Thus, if a Magistrate, upon receiving a complaint, after applying his mind decides to record the sworn statement of the complainant he can be said to have taken cognizance of the offence. It is not the requirement of law to actually record the sworn statement or proceed to issue summons to the accused to conclude that the Magistrate has taken cognizance of the offence mentioned in the complaint. Hence the examination of the complainant and his witnesses under S.200 and the subsequent inquiry, if any, under S. 202 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 after postponing the issue of process against the accused are all steps taken in the proceedings at the post-cognizance stage.\"Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 provides that the period of limitation means the period specified in S.468 for taking cognizance of an offence. S.468 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 provides that except as otherwise provided elsewhere in the Code, no Court, shall take cognizance of an offence of the category specified in sub-s.(2) of S.468, after the expiry of the period of limitation as provided therein. In view of the principles mentioned above, the contention that the bar of limitation would apply, is without substance.13. Moreover, S. 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973, no court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable, under S. 138 except upon a complaint in writing and such complaint is made within one month of the date on which the cause of action arises under Cl.(c) of the proviso to S. 138. Therefore, the period of limitation is to be computed with reference to the date on which the cause of action arises and the complaint is to be filed within the time prescribed. The date of taking cognizance has no relevance in a complaint under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.14. The petitioners seek to quash the complaint on another ground as well. Counsel relied upon the decision in Sudha Beevi v. State of Kerala (2004 (2) KLT 746)2004 (2) KLT 746. In the said decision it is held that after taking possession of the motor vehicle covered by hire purchase agreement, the complainant could not proceed with a complaint under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 on the basis of the cheques issued by the accused. Counsel for the company submitted that the said decision requires re-consideration. In these cases, I am not deciding these contentions since on the basis of the findings rendered by me, the matter has to go back to the learned Magistrates concerned. All the contentions of the parties on this question are left open.15. Shri K.S. Madhusoodanan, counsel appearing for the accused Surendran submitted that the dispute between the accused and the complainant has been settled by compromise entered between the parties during the pendency of O.S.No.5396 of 2004 on the file of the City Civil Court, Chennai. Crl.M.A.No. 5031 of 2007 is filed by the counsel for the accused stating these facts and a copy of the judgment in the suit is produced. Counsel for the complainant has not received instructions as to whether the company intends to proceed further with the complaint in the five cases filed against Surendran. It is hoped, if the company has received the full amount due to it, it would not proceed further with the complaint against Surendran.16. For the aforesaid reasons, I hold that before issuing process to the accused, learned Magistrate should have examined the complainant upon oath as provided under S.200 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The proceedings of the learned Magistrate to that extent are set aside. The learned Magistrate shall proceed in accordance with law after complying with the mandatory requirements of S.200 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Learned counsel for the complainant submitted that the complainant may be permitted to file an affidavit in view of the examination under S. 145 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. If such a request is made before the learned Magistrate, it shall be dealt with in accordance with law. It is also made clear that I have not pronounced upon the question whether the complaint was filed within the time as provided under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.Criminal Miscellaneous cases are disposed of as above.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE V. RAM KUMAR1 .In this revision filed under S. 397 read with S.401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C. 933 of 2003 on the file of the J.F.C.M.-I, Pathanamthitta challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him concurrently by the courts below for an offence punishable under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as \"the N.I. Act\" for short).2. I heard Adv. Sri. K.P. Satheesan, the learned counsel for the revision petitioner and Advocate Sri. Philip Mathew, the learned counsel for the second respondent/ complainant.Argument of the Accused3. Assailing the conviction entered and the sentence passed against the revision petitioner, his learned counsel Dr.K.P. Satheesan, made the following submissions before me in support of the revision :-The complaint in this case was not filed by the complainant Jacob Thomas but by his power-of-attorney holder V.K. Abraham. A power-of-attorney has no role to play in representing the parties in criminal proceedings. However, in view of the various judicial pronouncements in this regard, complaints under S. 138 of the N.I. Act can be filed or continued by powers-of-attorney. But such a power-of-attomey can file or continue a complaint only with the prior permission of the Court for which purpose the motion must come from the party himself, i.e., the payee or holder-in-due-course (the complainant) and not the power of attorney. No permission was sought in this case either by the complainant or by the power-of-attorney holder under S.302 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or any other provision of law. Hence, the entire proceedings initiated and continued were illegal and a nullity in the eye of law. Under S.302 (2) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 any person conducting the prosecution may do so either personally or through a pleader. But if the complainant were to conduct the prosecution through a private person including a power-of-attorney (who is not a \"pleader\" within the meaning of S.2(q) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973) the complainant himself must obtain the permission of the Court and not his power-of-attorney holder. There is nothing in the proceedings of the trial court to show that such permission was ever sought by the complainant or granted by the court. A defective prosecution without the requisite authority is not a curable irregularity but a total illegality. The evidence of P.W. 1 the power-of-attorney holder suffers from the following defects:-a) He is not the person who allegedly lent the moneyb) He is not the person who is entitled to get back the moneyc) He is not the person who can legally claim the amount due under the cheque in questiond) He is not the person who allegedly received the cheque from the accused.e) He is not the person who presented the cheque in the drawee bank or got it dishonoured from the bankf) He is not the person who sent the statutory notice demanding the amount from the accused.g) He is not the person who received the reply notice from the accused. h) He is not the person who has personal knowledge about the financial transaction between the complainant and the accused.i) He is not the person competent to depose in respect of matters which are not within his personal knowledge.j) He is not the person entitled to get any document including the deed of power-of-attorney marked during trial as the said deed was executed by another person.If the power-of-attorney of the complainant were to engage a pleader or legal practitioner then it would amount to a delegate further delegating his function offending the well-known maxim \"delegatus non potest delegare\". In Mathai v. Principal District and Sessions Judge (1999 (1) KLT 157)1999 (1) KLT 157 a learned single Judge of this Court held that there must be a specific request by the parties to the Court for their representation in Court by a person who is a non- advocate and that a general power-of-attomey was not sufficient. The learned Judge in this connection' relied on the decision of the Apex Court in Hari Shankar Rastogi v. Girdhari Sharma & Anr. (AIR 1978 SC 1019)1978 AIR(SC) 10191978 ILO SC 160 where also it was held that the party to a criminal proceeding should seek permission of the court to be represented by a private person who is not an advocate. Again in T.C. Mathai & Anr. v. District and Sessions Judge, Thiruvananthapuram (1999 (2) KLT 1561999 (2) KLT 1561999 ILO SC 1041 (SC) = (1999) 3 SCC 614)1999 (3) SCC 6141999 ILO SC 1041 it was held by the Supreme Court that a power-of-attorney holder who is not a legal practitioner cannot represent a husband and wife arrayed as respondents in a criminal revision unless the husband and wife themselves seek the permission of the court in view of S.303 read with S2(q) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. In Jimmy Jahangir Madan v. Bolly Cariyappa Hindley (2004 (3) KLT 8502004 (3) KLT 8502004 ILO SC 904 (SC) = (2004) 12 SCC 509)2004 (12) SCC 5092004 ILO SC 904 the Supreme Court ruled that the application under S.302 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to continue the prosecution could not be filed by the power-of-attorney holder of the heirs of the deceased complainant in a prosecution under S.138 of the N.I. Act. It was held that the permission in that regard should be sought by the heirs of the deceased complainant. In Babu v. State of Kerala (1984 KLT 164)1984 KLT 164 a Division Bench of this Court had held that only in exceptional cases should the court allow the prosecution to be conducted by a private lawyer engaged by a party instead of the Public Prosecutor. In Dr. Bhagwant Singh v. Surjit Singh (1985 Crl.L.J. NOC 73) a learned single Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court held that even though for the presentation of the complaint the physical presence of the complainant before Court is not always essential, the normal rule is that he should be present in court unless he has justifiable reasons for not doing so. In H. Mohan v. State of Karnataka, a learned Judge of the Karnataka High Court has held that it is clear from the language employed by S. 142 of the N.I. Act that no court shall take recognizance of an offence punishable under S. 138 except upon a written complaint made by the payee and this means that the payee himself has to file the private complaint under S.200 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 before the competent Magistrate. On the question regarding the competence of the power-of-attorney - holder to give evidence as a witness before court in Joseph Mathew v. Jose Thomas (2005 (4) KLT 764)2005 (4) KLT 764 (SC) it was held by the Apex Court that it is impermissible for the son of the landlord holding a power-of-attorney of the landlord to give evidence in support of the bona fide need of the landlord. Again in Janki Vashdeo v. Indu Sind Bank (2005 (2) KLT 265)2005 (2) KLT 265 (SC) = (2005) 2 SCC 217)2005 (2) SCC 2172004 ILO SC 1030 the Apex Court held that even though a general power-of-attomey can appear, plead and act on behalf of the party he cannot become a witness on behalf of the party for the purpose of giving evidence in respect of matters over which the party alone has personal knowledge. The conviction entered and the sentence passed against the Revision Petitioner overlooking the above vital aspects of the matter cannot be sustained.Judicial Resolution4. I am afraid that I cannot agree with the above defence contentions which overlook the fact that in most of the prosecutions (including the one on hand) under S.138 of the N.I. Act, where a complaint is filed through a power-of-attorney, the holder of the power-of-attorney is not appointed or authorised to conduct the prosecution. The power-of-attorney comes in the picture only to fill the position of the complainant. The prosecution in such cases is conducted by the pleader or Advocate engaged by the power-of-attorney. There is, therefore, no occasion or need in such a case to invoke S.302 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 much less, seek the permission of the Court to conduct the prosecution either by the complainant or by the power-of-attorney.5. The law relating to power-of-attorney is a branch of the law of agency. Power -of-attorney is the legal written authority to transact business for another. It is the authority or power to act conferred upon an agent. The formal instrument or document by which that power or authority is conferred or guaranteed is also called \"power-of-attorney\". The person empowering another to represent him or act in his stead is called the donor or the principal and the person in whom authority is so conferred is called the do nee or the holder of the power-of-attorney. A general power-of-attorney is one by which authority is given to act for the principal in all matters of a particular nature or concerning a. particular business. A special power-of-attorney is one by which authority is given to do some particular specified act. A vakalathnama by which a party to a proceeding before a Court or Tribunal authorises a legal practitioner to appear and act on his behalf is also a power-of-attorney. S.2 of the Powers-Of-Attorney Act, 1882 reads as follows:-2. Execution under power-of-attorney:-- The do nee of a power-of-attorney may, if he thinks fit execute or do any instrument or thing, in and with his own name and signature, and his own seal, where sealing is required, by the authority of the donor of the power; and every instrument and thing so executed and done, shall be as effectual in law as if it had been executed or done by the do nee of the power in the name, and with signature and seal, of the donor thereof.This section applies to powers-of-attorney created by instruments executed either before of after this Act comes into force\".6. The above provision is the statutory recognition of the maxim 'Qui facit per allum facit per se' which means that he who does anything by another does it by himself. In other words, the general rule is that whatever a person may do himself he may authorise another to do for him. In Hamza v. Ibrahim (1993 (2) KLT 698)1993 (2) KLT 6981993 ILO KER 236 the question before a learned single judge of this Court (Mr. Justice K.T. Thomas) was as to whether the power-of-attorney-holder could make a complaint under S. 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 on behalf of the payee or holder-in-due-course. This is what the learned Judge observed:\"8. \"Power of attorney\" is the instrument by which a person is authorised to act as the agent of the person granting it (vide Black's Law Dictionary). In Stroud's \"Judicial Directory\", power of attorney is described as \"an authority whereby one is set in the turne, stead, or place of another to act for him\". Stone, C.J. has adopted the said definition as effective and acceptable in Ramdeo v. Lalu Natha. S.2 of the Powers-Of-Attorney Act, 1882 empowers the do nee of a power of attorney to do anything \"in and with his own name and signature\" by the authority of the donor of the power. The section declares that everything so done \"shall be as effectual in law as if it had beendone by the do nee of the power in the name and with the signature.....of the donor thereof, (shorn of words which are not necessary in this context). In the light of such declaration, the legal position is that the power of attorney holder can doevery thing empowered by the donor and all such acts done by the do nee shall have legal recognition and acceptance as though such acts were done by the donor him self.9. Making a complaint before a court is not an act which would fall within the exceptions envisaged by Venkatarama Ayyar, J. in Ravulu Subba Rao v. Income Tax Commissioner (AIR 1956 SC 604)1956 AIR(SC) 6041956 ILO SC 105 Patanjali Sastri, J. (as he then was) had stated in /. T. Commissioner v. Subba Rao (AIR 1946 Mad.411)1946 AIR(Mad) 4111946 ILO MAD 3 that S.2,Powers-Of-Attorney Act, 1882 cannot override the specific provision of a rule made under a different statute which requires that a particular act should be done by some one \"personally\". The bench was considering the effect of adding the word \"personally\" in R.6 of the Income Tax Rules framed under S.59 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 as per which an application for registration under S.26 A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 should have been signed by the partner personally. It was the said decision of the Madras High Court which reached the Supreme Court in Ravulu Subba Rao v. Income Tax Commissioner. But the principle enunciated in the said decision has no application to S. 142 of the N.I. 'Act since there is no requirement in it that the complaint should be made by the payee or holder in due course \"personally\". Parliament would have advisedly refrained from imposing such a restriction\".In Muthukaruppan v. Raghavan (2006 (2) KLT 996)2006 (2) KLT 996 a learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court has held that a complaint can be signed and filed and sworn statement also can be given by the power-of-attorney of the payee or holder-in-due course, but at the time of the trial of the payee or holder-in-due-course himself will have to mount the witness box. I will have occasion to.deal with the testimonial competence of the power-of-attorney to give evidence, a little later.7. Thus, the law does not insist that the payee or holder-in-due -course should personally file the complaint. A duly authorised power-of-attorney can file the complaint on behalf of the payee or holder-in-due-course. So long as the power-of-attorney does not seek to conduct the prosecution on behalf of the payee or holder in due course, the question of seeking permission in that behalf under S.302 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or the question as to who should seek such permission, do not arise.8. In Hari Shankar Rastogi's case (AIR 1978 SC 1019)1978 AIR(SC) 10191978 ILO SC 160 the question was as to whether a private person who was not an Advocate could be permitted to conduct the case of the party before Court. The Apex Court held that such a private person must get the prior permission of the Court for which the motion should come from the party himself and not the private person. This ruling cannot obviously apply to the present case since this is not a case where the power-of-attorney holder is seeking permission to conduct the case on behalf of the complainant. Likewise, the learned single Judge of this Court in Mathai v. Principal District and Sessions Judge (1999 (1) KIT 157)1999 (1) KIT 157 the Division Bench of this Court in T. C. Mathai v. Principal District & Sessions Judge (1999 (2) KLT 108)1999 (2) KLT 108 and the Hon'ble Supreme Court in T.C. Mathai & Anr. v. District and Sessions Judge, Thiruvananthapuram (1999 (2) KLT 151999 (2) KLT 15 = (1999) 3 SCC 614)1999 (3) SCC 6141999 ILO SC 1041 were all dealing with the question as to whether a private person who is not a legal practitioner and who is holding a power-of-attorney from the party could be permitted to conduct the case of such party. The courts took the view that such a private person could not conduct the case of the party without the prior permission of the court and that such permission should be sought not by the power-of-attorney-holder but by the party himself. In Jimmy Jahangir's case (2004 (3) KLT 8502004 (3) KLT 8502004 ILO SC 904 (SC) = (2004) 12 SCC 509)2004 (12) SCC 5092004 ILO SC 904 the question was evidently as to whether the power-of-attorney-holder could continue the proceedings after the death of the complainant in a prosecution under S. 138 of the N.I. Act without the legal heirs of the complainant seeking permission under S.302 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The very fact that S. 302 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 was invoked and interpreted will show that the power-of-attorney who was not a \"pleader\" within the meaning of S.2 (q) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 was not merely seeking to represent the legal heirs of the deceased complainant but was seeking to conduct the prosecution on their behalf in which case alone Ss.205 and 302 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 could have any application. In view of the decision in Hamza's case (ILR 1993 (2) Ker.698)1993 (2) ILR(KER) 698 to the effect that the power-of-attorney-holder of a payee or holder-in-due-course can file the complaint on behalf of the complainant, the view taken in Dr. Bag want Singh's case (1985 Crl.L.J NOC 73) by the Punjab & Haryana High Court that the complainant should be personally present at the time of presentation of the complaint before the Magistrate cannot have application, particularly, in a prosecution under S. 138 of the N.I. Act. It is pertinent to remember in this connection the decision of a learned Single Judge of this Court in Rajan George v. State of Kerala (1998 (2) KLT 497)1998 (2) KLT 497 wherein it was held that since the complainant was hospitalised on the last day of limitation, the complaint filed on his behalf by his pleader in the absence of the complainant could be treated as properly instituted and that the case could be posted to some future date for the purpose of recording the sworn statement of the complainant. That was also a prosecution under S.138 of the N.I. Act. There is, therefore, no justification whatsoever in insisting on permission of the court either by the complainant (payee or holder-in-due-course) or his power-of-attorney-holder if the purpose for which the power-of-attorney-holder is appointed is only to represent the complainant i.e. to play the limited role of taking the place of the complainant and nothing more and nothing less. This legal position is in no way different if the complainant were to die pending the proceedings and his legal heirs were to appoint a power-of-attorney-holder for the very same purpose.9. The only other question which is required to be considered is as to whether the power of attorney holder is competent to give evidence on behalf of the complainant. In Janki Vashdeo's case (2005 (2) KLT 2652005 (2) KLT 265 (SC) = (2005) 2 SCC 217)2005 (2) SCC 2172004 ILO SC 1030 the decision was rendered in a civil proceedings. Interpreting the various provisions under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 particularly O.3 R.1 it was held that the power of attorney cannot depose in respect of matters which are in the exclusive knowledge of his principal. In Joseph Mathew's case (2005 (4) KLT 764)2005 (4) KLT 764 also eviction was sought on the ground of bona fide need of the landlord and not that of his son. Hence it was held that it was impermissible for the son who was holding the power-of-attorney of the landlord to give evidence in support of the bona fide need of the landlord. This case again was a civil proceeding.10. By the power-of-attorney-holder of the complainant giving instructions to the advocate for sending the statutory notice or for the conduct of the case he is not offending the principle of delegatus non potest delegare. In Pandalai v. Jacob C. Alexander ( 2000 (2) KLT 59)2000 (2) KLT 59 it was held by this Court that as long as the power-of-attorney of the payee of a cheque in a prosecution under S.138 of the N.I. Act does not act or plead for the principal, there is no legal impediment in his giving instructions to the Advocate. In Anirudhan v. Philip Jacob (2006 (3) KLT 554)2006 (3) KLT 554 this Court had held that the power-of-attorney of the complainant in a prosecution under S.138 of the N.I. Act will be a competent witness if he-were to speak of facts which are within his knowledge. In the case on hand, the power-of-attorney who was examined as P.W. 1 is none other than the Manager of the complainant who is running a financial institution by name Mulamoottil Bankers. Since he was fully conversant with the facts starting with the borrowal and ending with the filing of the complaint, he was perfectly competent to give evidence on behalf of the complainant. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the finding of guilt. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner and I confirm the same.11. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the first respondent complainant by way of compensation under S.357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs. 1, 00, 000/-(Rupees one lakh only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the Court. If the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence.12. Amounts, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, passed by the lower appellate court or this Court shall be refunded to the petitioner.13. In the light of the foregoing discussion, the inescapable conclusion is as follows:i) Since the law does not insist that the payee or holder-in-due-course should personally file the complaint, his duly authorised power-of-attorney can file the complaint on his behalf.ii) As long as there is no request before court that the power-of-attorney-holder of the complainant (payee or holder-in-due-course) should be permitted to conduct the prosecution without engaging a pleader or legal practitioner, there is no question of S. 302 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 coming into operation obliging the complainant himself to seek permission of the Court to allow the power-of-attorney-holder to conduct the prosecution.iii) Such power-of-attorney can also give evidence before court on behalf of the payee or holder-in-due-course if the facts necessary to secure a conviction are within his personal knowledge.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Order accordingly"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding.The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence in the light of the recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court that no default sentence can be imposed for an order for compensation under Section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 The sentence imposed on the revision petitioner is set aside and instead he is sentenced to pay fine of Rs.1, 10, 000/-(Rupees one lakh and ten thousand only)(giving credit to the sum of Rs.1, 00, 000/- already deposited before the trial court pursuant to the orders passed by this court and which shall be ordered to be withdrawn by the 2nd respondent/complainant) on or before 16.11.2007 and on default to make the payment, he shall suffer simple imprisonment for three months. The revision petitioner shall appear before the trial Court on 16.11.2007 to pay the sum of Rs.1, 10, 000/- directly to the 2nd respondent/complainant in Court.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

On the contrary, the allegation in the complaint so as to bring it under section 420 Indian Penal Code, 1860 is that when the cheque was presented it was dishonoured for the reason that the account was closed. Annexure-Iprivate complaint does not contain allegations to the effect that the account particulars obtained from the drawee bank revealed that the account holder was not the accused but somebody else. On the contrary, it is admitted that this information came to the knowledge of the revision petitioner only during the course of C.C.No.1203/05 and which was not known to him when he instituted the said private complaint. If so, the court below cannot be faulted for dismissing the petition for alteration of charge.The order passed by the court below is upheld. But it is made clear that the dismissal of the said petition will not preclude the revision petitioner from filing a fresh complaint with necessary materials for prosecuting the respondent/accused for an offence punishable under section 420 Indian Penal Code, 1860 if he is so advised.This revision is disposed of as above.Petition disposed of"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE V. RAMKUMAR1. In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in S.T.Case No.3147/2004 on the file of the J.F.C.M.-II, Palakkad challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice.4. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner made the following further submissions before me:-Even at the stage of Ext.P5 reply notice the accused had taken up the defence that he had lost two cheques and one of the cheques has been misused by the complainant for filing the complaint. The accused was examined as DW1 and he stated that the complainant borrowed Rs.25, 000/- from the accused as per a cheque issued by him on 15.5.02 and when that amount was demanded back, the relationship between the accused and the complainant's brother-in-law Induchoodan got strained and Induchoodan who was a frequent visitor in the house of the accused had stolen the blank cheque from the custody of the accused and had misused the same. Moreover, the date of cheque which was originally 2.2.04 has been corrected as 3.2.04 and this amounts to material alteration rendering the document void under section 87 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The courts below have overlooked these vital aspects while convicting the accused.5. I am afraid that I cannot agree with the above submissions. The lower appellate court did address itself to the above contention and noted that the definite case of the accused in Ext.P5 reply notice that he had lost two cheque leaves was not even suggested to PW1 when he was cross-examined. As DW1 the revision petitioner came out with a third version PW1, the complainant, has denied the suggestion that there is material alteration in the date of the cheque. The specific case of PW1 was that the cheque filled in all respects as it is now found was brought and the accused affixed his signature in his presence. He was not asked to whether the correction in the date was subsequent to the handing over of the cheque. If the date was corrected even at the time of drawing of the cheque, it cannot amount to material alteration. Material alteration so as to render a document void should be one which is subsequently made without the consent or concurrence of the drawer of the cheque. No such question was put to PW1. The accused had also not taken any steps against Induchoodan for allegedly stealing blank cheque leaves from the accused.It was after taking note of all these circumstances that the courts below disbelieved the defence set up by the revision petitioner. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below.The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.6. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition here in after mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.1, 50, 000/- (Rupees one lakh and fifty thousand only) within five months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE V. RAMKUMAR1. In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C. No.18/2002 on the file of the Additional CJM, Thalassery challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice.4. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner made the following further submissions before me:-The definite case of the revision petitioner/accused is that he had entrusted a signed blank cheque with the accused in the year 1995 while he borrowed a sum of Rs.10, 000/- and he had discharged the liability there under in the year 1995 itself. The case of the complainant that the accused borrowed Rs.50, 000/- under Ext.P1 cheque in the year 2001 is false. The complainant examined as PW1 had admitted in unmistakable terms that he had seen the accused filling up the cheque and affixing his signature.This will go to show that according to PW1, it was not a blank cheque which was handed over to him. The revision petitioner had filed an application before the trial court for sending the cheque to the handwriting expert to check whether the handwriting in the body of the cheque as well as the signature were of the same person. That request was rejected and the lower appellate court has also failed to consider these aspects of the matter. When the signed blank cheque was offered only as a security without any express or implied authority given to PW1 to fill up the same, no prosecution would lie on the basis of the said cheque.5. I am afraid that I cannot agree with the above submissions. It is true that PW1 has deposed after more than one year of the handing over of the cheque that the accused had filled up the cheque as well as affixed his signature to the same in his presence. But then the courts below did not believe the explanation offered by the accused as to how the cheque leaf belonging to the accused and pertaining to the account maintained by him came into the hands of the complainant. His definite case in this behalf was that he had borrowed a sum of Rs.10, 000/- from the complainant in the year 1995 and had given a signed blank cheque as security. He claims to have repaid the loan in the year 1995 itself. If that were true, then, as a reasonable and prudent man, he should have demanded the cheque back. There is nothing forthcoming to indicate that he had demanded the cheque back. He does not appear to have even sent a lawyer notice to the complainant for his failure to return the cheque leaf even after the accused discharging his liability under the loan transaction.Even if the handwriting other than the signature in Ext.P1 cheque does not belong to the accused, it must be inferred that he had given implied authority to the complainant to fill up the same and use the same. I see no illegality in the refusal by the trial court to send the cheque to the handwriting expert for comparison. I am fortified in this connection by the decisions reported in Francis Vs. Pradeep [2004 (2) KLT 1080]2004 (2) KLT 1080 and Baby Thomas Vs. T.T. Paul and another [2007 (3) KHC 732]2007 (3) KHC 732. Hence reliance placed on K.G.Bindu Vs. P.Sreekantan Nair and another [2007 (1) KLD Crl. 104] cannot go to the rescue of the revision petitioner.Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below.The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.6. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 2nd respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.50, 000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only) within three months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE V. RAMKUMAR1. In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in S.T. No.1660/2002 on the file of the J.F.C.M., Mannarkkad challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice.4. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner made the following further submissions before me:-When the matter was pending before the trial court, the accused had executed Annexure-A registered document on 29.9.03 assigning 10 cents of land in favour of the complainant who has paid valuable consideration for the same. If, as a matter of fact, a sum of Rs.1, 00, 000/- was due to the complainant under Ext.P1 cheque dated 18.6.02 the complainant would not have taken assigning of 10 cents of land again paying consideration for the same. In Annexure-B complaint dated 12.8.05 preferred by the revision petitioner before the Superintendent of Police, Palakkad he has specifically mentioned about the fact that the assignment of 10 cents of land was in discharge of his liability under Ext.P1 cheque. Such being the position, the conviction and sentence passed against the revision petitioner cannot stand.5. I am afraid that I cannot agree with the above submissions. The borrowal was on 8.3.02 and the amount borrowed was Rs.1, 00, 000/-. Subsequently, on 18.6.02 Ext.P1 cheque was issued by the accused to the complainant for the sum of Rs.1, 00, 000/- borrowed by him. The complainant was examined as PW1 in the year 2005. If execution of Annexure-A document on 29.9.03 was in discharge of the liability under Ext.P1, one would have expected at least a suggestion to PW1 in that behalf. There was not even a whisper in that direction. As for Annexure-B complaint it is preferred after the judgment of the trial court and the averments therein are only the interested and self- serving averments made by the revision petitioner. The learned counsel appearing for the 1st respondent complainant submits that the said complaint was referred as false. Under these circumstances, it is futile for the revision petitioner to contend that the execution of the sale deed by the accused in favour of the complainant on 29.9.03 was in discharge of the liability under Ext.P1.Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.6. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.1, 00, 000/- (Rupees one lakh only) within five months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

        "text": "The Order of the Court was as follows :1. Heard arguments of Advocate Sri.R.T. Pradeep for the petitioner and Sri.M.Ramesh Chander for the second respondent.2. The petitioner is the same in all these cases. He is the accused in C.C. 136/02 and C.C. 272/03 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-V, Thiruvanahthapuram; and C.C. 454/01 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-Ill, Thiruyananthapuram in relation respectively to which these Crl.M.C's arise. All the above calendar cases are filed by the second respondent complaining of commission by the petitioner as also accused Nos.1 and 2 of offence punishable under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The first accused is M/s. Alsa Spring Fields, a company of which the second accused is the Managing Director and the petitioner/ third accused is the Project Manager at Thiruvananthapuram. The company was at the relevant time engaged in constmction activities inter alia of residential apartments. The second respondent/the defacto complainant had advanced funds for allotment of a flat at Ernakulam but consequent on dropping up of the proposed venture at Ernakulam, the company ascertained its willingness to have a flat allotted in the residential complex that was undertaken by the company at Thiruvananthapuram. The petitioner was not agreeable. Hence, towards repayment of the amounts advanced by the second respondent on instructions from those at the helm of affairs of the firstaccused/company, the petitioner/third accused issued three cheques over and above making a cash payment of Rs.50, 000/- to the second respondent. It so happened that all the three post dated cheques were being issued admittedly on 25/09/2000 on which day was Annexure-III order passed by the Company Court at Madras ordering winding up of the first accused/ company. Even the second respondent has no case that cheques were being issued by the petitioner being aware of Annexure-III order ordering winding up of the first accused/company. The cheques issued by the petitioner were all dishonoured by the drawee bank/The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. But cheque No.224620 was being dishonoured vide Annexure-V/Dishonour Memorandum dt. 01/11/2000 assigning the reason \"Funds Insufficient\". Cheque No.224621 which is subject matter in Crl.M.C. ' 462/04 and cheque No.224623 which is subject matter in Crl.M.C.459/04 were being dishonoured respectively under Annexure-V/Dishonour Memorandums filed in those cases assigning the reason \"operations stopped by the court\".3. It is vehemently contended before me by the learned counsel for the petitioner that as per Annexure-III order of the Company Court, Madras, the first accused/third respondent company was wound up on 25/09/2000 and the company has become non est and what remained was the proceeding for distribution of its assets by the official liquidator and that therefore, by application of S. 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, it cannot be said that the petitioner who has drawn the cheque in favour of the second respondent on behalf of the third respondent/company which is non est is liable for offence under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. It is not in dispute that the company owed amounts to the second respondent and it was in discharge of that liability, that all the three cheques were issued by the petitioner who was the Project Manager of the company at Thiruvananthapuram on behalf of the company. Admittedly, there is no evidence as to whether the cheques were being issued with knowledge of Annexure-III order. However, the drawee bank was also not aware of the winding up proceedings and they had also not been prohibited from making payments from the account of the first accused/company as on the date of dishonour of Annexure-V cheque involved in C.C. 136/02 aforesaid and the reason for dishonour is \"Funds Insufficient\". It cannot be said that no offence under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 stands made out at least prima facie in relation to the dishonour of cheque No.224620 vide Annexure-III dishonour memorandum which has given rise to the complaint in C.C. 136/02. Hence, there is no merit in Crl.M.C. 461/04.4. As far as the cheques which are subject matter of complaint in C.C.272/03 and C.C.454/01, the reason for dishonour assigned is \"operations stopped by the court\". When by reason of an order of court, bank was necessarily not to make any payment from out of the accounts of the first accused/company, it is unjust and illegal to say that an employee of the company like the petitioner who has issued those two cheques to the second respondent on behalf of the first accused/ company on directions from those at the helm of affairs of the company as on the date of issuance of those cheques, can be held liable for offence under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.5. It is vehemently contended by the counsel for the second respondent relying on the decision in Pankaj Mehra v. State of Maharashtra (2000 (2) KLT 3382000 (2) KLT 3382000 ILO SC 141 (SC)) that when a company goes into liquidation, enforcement of debt due from the company is only made subject to the conditions prescribed therein, but that does not mean that debt has become unenforceable altogether and hence, that is no premise to hold that debt is legally unenforceable though the modality of its realisation can only be as provided in the Companies Act, 1956 and that cheque issued on behalf of the company when dishonoured, the drawee, in any event, cannot escape from the penal provisions of S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 which creates a statutory offence and that the drawer of the cheque when he fails to make the payment has necessarily to be held liable for offence under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 though under the circumstances in which he has rendered himself liable for the offence, he can plea for a lesser sentence being awarded. The said contention does not worth any merit in view of the fact that the cheques were being dishonoured for reason of payments being disabled to be made as operation of the account was stopped by court orders.6. It is also contended by the counsel for the second respondent in view of the decision of the Apex Court in S.M. S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Neeta Bhalla (2005 (4) KLT 2092005 (4) KLT 209 (SC)) that so far as the signatory of the cheque is concerned when the cheque is dishonoured, he is clearly responsible for the incriminating act and he will be fastened with liability under S. 141(1) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The said argument also will not hold good for the reasons already stated when the payment was being stopped as per orders of court. Consequently therefore, the proceedings in C.C. 272/03 and C.C.454/01 aforesaid are liable to be quashed in relation to the petitioner.7. In the result, I dismiss this Crl.M.CNo.461/04 but allowing Crl.M.C Nos.459/04 and 462/04.I quash the proceedings in C.C. Nos.272/03 and 454/01 respectively on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-V and Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-Ill, Thiruvananthapuram inasmuch as it is as against the petitioner who is the third accused in the case.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE V. RAMKUMAR1. Styling himself to be the Managing Partner of a partnership firm by name Sreekrishna Agencies, Muthuvattor represented by his power-of-attorney holder one Basheer @ Basheerkhan, the revision petitioner (Nazar) filed a complaint under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 in respect of a cheque for a sum of Rs. 1, 50, 000 allegedly issued by the accused. The complaint was registered as CM.P. No. 5144 of 2007 on the file of the J.F.C.M, Irinjalakkuda.2. As per the averments in the complaint, the complainant is a dealer in petroleum products and the accused was a customer of the partnership firm by name Sreekrishna Agencies and in discharge of a legally enforceable debt towards the said firm, the accused handed over the cheque dated 24-5-2005 for Rs. 1, 50, 000/- drawn on the Chavakkad Branch of the City Union Bank, when the cheque was presented through the State Bank of Travancore, Irinjalakkuda, it was dishonoured by the drawee bank due to insufficiency of fund and in spite of due receipt of the statutory notice the accused did not pay the cheque amount.3. The learned Magistrate held that even though the cheque was in the name of the partnership firm by name Sreekrishna Agencies, the complaint was filed by the Managing Partner of Sreekrishna Agencies and that the Managing Partner not being the payee or holder-in-due-course was not entitled to file the complaint. The complaint was accordingly dismissed on 10-08-2007 as not maintainable.4. Since the complaint was dismissed even without issuing process to the accused, notice to the accused is dispensed with in this revision.5. The stand taken by the Magistrate cannot be supported in law. It is true that the cheque in question is drawn in favour of Sreekrishna Agencies of which the complainant is admittedly the Managing Partner. Had it been a civil suit, Nasar, the Managing Partner would have been, by virtue of the provisions of O.XXX Code Of Civil Procedure, 1908, entitled to sue or be sued in the name of the firm. But in the absence of any enabling provision in the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the Managing Partner is not entitled to file a complaint in the name of the firm. However, any partner including the Managing Partner who is an agent of the firm is entitled to file a complaint on behalf of the firm. In the absence of a provision analogous to O.XXX Code Of Civil Procedure, 1908, it is not permissible to file a complaint in the name of the firm. The position would be different if it is the accused which is a partnership firm in which case the legal fiction under S. 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, would operate. Even in the case of a suit instituted by or in the name of a firm, the legal position is that it is really a suit by or in the name of its partners and the decree passed against the firm is in effect a decree against all the partners. See Mandalassa Devi v. Ram Narayan (AIR 1965 SC 1718)1965 AIR(SC) 17181965 ILO SC 116. The revision petitioner who is the Managing Partner of the firm which in turn is the payee under the cheque was perfectly competent to lodge the complaint. The order dated 10-8-2007 passed by the Magistrate is unsustainable and is accordingly dislodged. C.M.P. No. 5144 of 2007 will therefore stand restored to file and shall be proceeded with in accordance with law.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE K. R. UDAYABHANU1. The appellant is the complainant company in C.C.No.342/97 with respect to the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 which stands dismissed and the accused acquitted.2. The case of the complainant is that the impugned cheque for a sum of Rs.57, 188.44 issued by the respondent/ accused towards the discharge of the value of the goods purchased got dishonoured for want of funds in the account of the accused. The lawyer notice sent was not replied to nor was the amount paid.3. The evidence adduced in the matter consisted of the testimony of PWs' 1 and 2 and Exts. P1 to P7. The defence examined DWs' 1 to 3 and got marked Exts. D1 and D2.4. The contentions raised on facts were found against the accused and the court held that Ext. P2 cheque was issued to the complainant towards the discharge of liability and that the statutory formalities contemplated by the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 has been complied with. The accused was acquitted on the solitary ground that PW1 who represented the company at the time of trial was not properly authorised in this behalf.5. Although notice was served on the respondent there is no appearance.6. It is the finding of the court below that PW1 who represented the complainant subsequent to the filing of the complaint by another power of attorney holder cannot be treated as competent to represent the company as the document of authority authorising executant of the power of attorney i.e., the General Manager (Finance) has not been produced before the court below. It is submitted that PW1 is one of the executives of the company and it is the same General Manager (Finance) who had executed the earlier power of attorney to one Mr.Kannan who had filed the complaint and it was in the case of the contingency of the earlier power of attorney holder leaving the company that Ext. P1 authorisation in favour of PW1 has been executed. The application to substitute the earlier power of attorney holder by PW1 was allowed after notice to the respondent. The counsel for the revision petitioner has relied on the decision reported in this regard in Atul Mathur vs. Atul Kalra (1989 (4) SCC 514)1989 (4) SCC 5141989 ILO SC 828. The similar contention as herein was rejected by the apex court. So also in Associated Cement Co. Ltd. vs. Keshavanand (1998 (1) SCC 6871998 (1) SCC 6871997 ILO SC 1230 the Supreme Court has made it clear that it would not be possible for a company to be represented by a person for ever as the particular person may subsequently ceased to be associated with the affairs of the company and hence, it is open to the de jure complainant company to seek permission of the court for sending any other person to represent the company in the court. The decision of this court in Mulammoottil Consumer Credit Ltd. vs. Sreenivasan (2006(4)KLT 543)2006 (4) KLT 543 on the above point has also relied on the above cited decision. The counsel for the appellant has also brought to the notice of this court that Section 54 of the Companies Act, 1956 which specifically lays down that a document or proceeding required authentication by a company may be signed by a Director, Manager, Secretary or other authorised officer of the company and it need not be under its common seal. I find that in view of the above position of law the finding of the court below that PW2 cannot be treated as an authorised representative of the company is liable to be set aside; and I do so.7. In the circumstances, the accused/respondent is convicted for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and sentenced to imprisonment till the rising of the court and to pay a compensation of Rs.70, 000/- and in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for three months. He shall appear before the court below on 24.8.2007 to receive the sentence.The criminal revision petition is disposed of as above.Petition disposed of"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE K. R. UDAYABHANU1. The appellant is the complainant company in C.C.No.343/97 with respect to the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 which stands dismissed and the accused acquitted.2. The case of the complainant is that the impugned cheque for a sum of Rs.49, 956.25 issued by the respondent/ accused towards the discharge of the value of the goods purchased got dishonoured for want of funds in the account of the accused. The lawyer notice sent was not replied to nor was the amount paid.3. The evidence adduced in the matter consisted of the testimony of PWs' 1 and 2 and Exts. P1 to P7. The defence examined DWs' 1 and 2 and got marked Ext. D1.4. The contentions raised on facts were found against the accused and the court held that Ext. P1 cheque was issued to the complainant towards the discharge of liability and that the statutory formalities contemplated by the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 has been complied with. The accused was acquitted on the solitary ground that PW2 who represented the company at the time of trial was not properly authorised in this behalf.5. Although notice was served on the respondent there was no appearance.6. It is the finding of the court below that PW2 who represented the complainant subsequent to the filing of the complaint by another power of attorney holder cannot be treated as competent to represent the company as the document of authority authorising executant of the power of attorney i.e., the General Manager (Finance) has not been produced before the court below. It is submitted that PW2 is one of the executives of the company and it is the same General Manager (Finance) who had executed the earlier power of attorney to one Mr.Kannan who had filed the complaint and it was in the case of the contingency of the earlier power of attorney holder leaving the company that Ext. P4 authorisation in favour of PW2 has been executed. The application to substitute the earlier power of attorney holder by PW2 was allowed after notice to the respondent. The counsel for the revision petitioner has relied on the decision reported in this regard in Atul Mathur vs. Atul Kalra (1989 (4) SCC 514)1989 (4) SCC 5141989 ILO SC 828. The similar contention herein was rejected by the apex court so also in Associated Cement Co. Ltd. vs. Keshavanand (1998(1) SCC 6871998 (1) SCC 6871997 ILO SC 1230 the Supreme Court has made it clear that it would not be possible for a company to be represented by a person for ever as the particular person may subsequently ceased to be associated with the affairs of the company and hence, it is open to the de jure complainant company to seek permission of the court for sending any other person to represent the company in the court. The decision of this court in Mulammoottil Consumer Credit Ltd. vs. Sreenivasan (2006(4)KLT 543)2006 (4) KLT 543 on the above point has also relied on the above cited decision. The counsel for the appellant has also brought to the notice of this court that Section 54 of the Companies Act, 1956 which specifically lays down that a document or proceeding required authentication by a company may be signed by a Director, Manager, Secretary or other authorised officer of the company it need not be under its common seal. I find that in view of the above position of law the finding of the court below that PW2 cannot be treated as an authorised representative of the company is liable to be set aside; and I do so.7. In the circumstances, the accused/respondent is convicted for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and sentenced to imprisonment till the rising of the court and to pay a compensation of Rs.66, 000/- and in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for three months. He shall appear before the court below on 24.8.2007 to receive the sentence.The criminal appeal is disposed of as above.Appeal disposed of"

The petitioners are the accused and the complainant in a prosecution under Sec.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. According to them, they have settled their disputes. The 1st petitioner/ complainant wants to withdraw the case against the 2nd petitioner. An application to that effect has been filed also before the learned Magistrate. But the learned Magistrate, the petitioners complain, is not disposing of the case. A warrant of arrest has been issued against the 2nd petitioner/accused. In these circumstances, they pray that directions under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 may be issued in aid of justice quashing the proceedings.2. Report of the learned Magistrate was called for. The learned Magistrate has reported that an application for withdrawal had been received but the learned Magistrate entertained doubts about the genuineness of the said application for withdrawal. The complainant was absent. His counsel was also absent. Another counsel represented the matter and it is in these circumstances that doubts arouse and the learned Magistrate did not choose to accept the prayer for compensation.3. The 1st petitioner submits that he does not want to join issue on the correctness of the report made by the learned Magistrate, but submits that the complainant shall appear before the learned Magistrate and submit that he wants to withdraw the complaint. The case is now posted to 6.8.07, it is submitted.4. I am satisfied that appropriate directions can be issued in the matter.i) It is directed that warrant of arrest issued against the 2nd petitioner/accused shall not be executed till 6.8.07.ii) It is directed that the 1st petitioner/complainant shall appear before the learned Magistrate and file a fresh application for withdrawal of the case. The learned Magistrate shall consider the same and pass appropriate orders on 6.8.07 itself.ii) The action taken by the learned Magistrate in this matter shall be communicated to this Court by the learned Magistrate after 6.8.07.5. This Crl.M.C. is allowed to the above extent.Order accordingly"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re- iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner.Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays or deposits before the court below by way of compensation under Sec. 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs. 90, 000/- (Rupees Ninety thousand only) within two months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence.5. Amount, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re- iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the first respondent complainant by way of compensation under Sec. 357 (3) Cr.P.C. a sum of Rs. 49, 400/- (Rupees Forty nine thousand four hundred only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence.5.

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re- iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the first respondent complainant by way of compensation under Sec. 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs. 2, 50, 000/- (Rupees Two lakhs Fifty Thousand only) within five months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence.5. Amount, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in S.T. No.558/03 on the file of the CJM, Pathanamthitta the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.75, 000/- (Rupees seventy five thousand only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C. No.270/02 on the file of the J.F.C.M.-I, Kottarakkara challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice.4. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner further contended that eventhough the correct address of the accused is shown in Ext.P4 statutory notice, in the envelope in which the notice was enclosed a different address was shown with the place stated as Koodal instead of Adoor and it was returned unserved with the endorsement that it was unclaimed. This according to the counsel, is not a proper notice which is a sine qua non for a prosecution under section 138 of the NI Act.5. It may be true that the address shown in Ext.P4 notice and the address on the envelope in which the notice was sent are different. But then, the parties are not strangers and it was not even suggested to PW1 that the address written on the envelope in which Ext.P4 notice was enclosed was wrong address. Even without putting this to PW1, it was not permissible for the accused to raise the above point, particularly when the said point was not seen urged before the lower appellate court. I, therefore, do not find any merit in the submission.6. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.2, 00, 000/- (Rupees two lakhs only) within five months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.80, 000/- (Rupees eighty thousand only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

The petitioner finds a warrant of arrest issued by the learned Magistrate chasing him. According to the petitioner, he is absolutely innocent. He is willing to appear before the learned Magistrate and apply for bail. He could not earlier appear as he was employed abroad. The petitioner apprehends that his application for bail may not be considered by the learned Magistrate on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. It is therefore prayed that directions under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 may be issued in favour of the petitioner.2. It is for the petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate and explain to the learned Magistrate the circumstances under which he could not earlier appear before the learned Magistrate. I have no reason to assume that the learned Magistrate would not consider such application on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. Every court must do the same. No special or specific direction appears to be necessary. Sufficient general directions have already been issued in Alice George v. The Deputy Superintendent of Police [2003(1) KLT 339]2003 (1) KLT 339.3. This Crl.M.C is, in these circumstances, dismissed, but with the specific observation that if the petitioner appears before the learned Magistrate and applies for bail after giving sufficient prior notice to the Prosecutor in charge of the case, the learned Magistrate must proceed to pass appropriate orders on merits and expeditiously - on the date of surrender itself.Hand over a copy of this order to the learned counsel for the petitioner.Order accordingly"

Cognizance has been taken. The petitioner had appeared before the learned Magistrate. He was enlarged on bail on 09.08.07. When the case was posted to a date later, the petitioner did not appear before the learned Magistrate. There was no representation for him. The learned Magistrate thereupon issued non bailable warrant to procure the presence of the petitioner. According to the petitioner, the petitioner is absolutely innocent. His absence was not wilful. He had mistakenly taken the date as 08.09.07 and that is why he was not present on 09.08.07. There has been a couple of postings in quick succession after 09.08.07. On coming to note that a warrant of arrest has been issued by the learned Magistrate against the petitioner, the petitioner wants to appear before the learned Magistrate and apply for bail. The petitioner apprehends that his application for regular bail may not be considered by the learned Magistrate on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. It is therefore prayed that directions under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 may be issued in favour of the petitioner.2. It is for the petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate and explain to the learned Magistrate the circumstances under which he could not earlier appear before the learned Magistrate. I have no reason to assume that the learned Magistrate would not consider such application on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. Every court must do the same. No special or specific direction appears to be necessary. Sufficient general directions have already been issued in Alice George v. The Deputy Superintendent of Police [2003(1) KLT 339]2003 (1) KLT 339.3. This Crl.M.C is, in these circumstances, dismissed, but with the specific observation that if the petitioner appears before the learned Magistrate and applies for bail after giving sufficient prior notice to the Prosecutor in charge of the case, the learned Magistrate must proceed to pass appropriate orders on merits and expeditiously - on the date of surrender itself.4. There shall be a further direction that the warrant of arrest issued against the petitioner shall not be executed till 08.09.07. On or before that date, the petitioner shall surrender before the learned Magistrate and seek regular bail.Hand over a copy of this order to the learned counsel for the petitioner.Order accordingly"

The common petitioner in these two Crl.M.Cs faces indictment in two separate prosecutions, both under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 initiated by different complainants. Cognizance has been taken by the learned Magistrate. The petitioner has not appeared before the learned Magistrate so far. In these circumstances, the learned Magistrate has issued coercive processes against the petitioner. She apprehends that she may be arrested in execution of the non bailable warrant issued by the learned Magistrate.2. According to the petitioner, the petitioner is absolutely innocent. Her omission/failure to appear earlier before the learned Magistrate was not wilful, but was due to reasons beyond her control. She is willing to co-operate with the court for the expeditious disposal of the case and to surrender and seek bail. But she apprehends that her application for bail may not be considered by the learned Magistrate on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. It is therefore prayed that directions under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 may be issued in favour of the petitioner.2. It is for the petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate and explain to the learned Magistrate the circumstances under which she could not earlier appear before the learned Magistrate. I have no reason to assume that the learned Magistrate would not consider such application on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. Every court must do the same. No special or specific direction appears to be necessary. Sufficient general directions have already been issued in Alice George v.

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE PIUS C. KURIAKOSE1. This writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution Of India, 1950 has been filed by the petitioners, who are accused Nos. 2 and 3 in C.P.Case.No.336/2005 on the files of the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Bokaro in Bihar for quashing the complaint, a copy of which is Ext.P1 in this writ petition. The accusation against the petitioners is that they along with accused Nos. 1 and 4 are guilty of offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The petitioners are respectively the mother and sister of accused No.1. The quashment of the complaint is sought for mainly on the ground that even the allegations in the complaint do not make out any offence against the petitioners.2. I have heard the submissions of Sri.S.Sanal Kumar, the learned counsel for the petitioners and also those of the learned Public Prosecutor. Placing strong reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court on S.M. S.Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Neeta Bhalla And Another (2005) 8 Supreme Court Cases 89)2005 (8) SCC 892005 ILO SC 560, the learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that the essential averments to make out a case against the petitioners who are alleged to be partners of the first accused under under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 are absent in Ext.P1 complaint and, therefore, the complaint is liable to be quashed . The full text of Ext.P1 was read over to me by the learned counsel who drew my attention to Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Counsel submitted that the cheque in respect of which offence under Section 138 is alleged is admitted in the complaint itself to be drawn not on the account of the firm but on a joint account of accused Nos.1 and 4. The counsel also submitted that it is not stated at all in the complaint that the petitioners are in charge of the affairs of the firm. The above submissions of the learned counsel certainly have merit, but I notice that under Ext.P1 complaint offence under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 is also alleged. Of course the learned counsel argued that offence under Section 420 is also not made out by the averments in the complaint. This aspect of the matter is to be considered by the Learned Magistrate.3. Under the above circumstances, I permit the petitioners to file an application before the learned Magistrate through their Advocate in the court below for a preliminary hearing of the matter regarding the maintainability of the complaint and for their discharge on the ground that the offences alleged against them are not made out even on the averments of the complaint. If the petitioners file an appropriate application before the learned Magistrate as indicated herein above within one month of their receiving a copy of this judgment, the learned Magistrate will hear the petitioners through the counsel and pass orders thereon within another one month thereafter. Considering the above directions and the merit noticed by him in the submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioners regarding the offence alleged under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, I exempt the petitioners from personally appearing before the learned Magistrate till orders are passed by the learned Magistrate on the application suggested as above. I am sure that the learned Magistrate will insist on the personal appearance of the accused petitioners only when the same is absolutely necessary even if the decision on the application comes to be against the petitioners.The writ petition is disposed of as above. No costs.Petition disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.1, 80, 000/- (Rupees one lakh and eighty thousand only) within six months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

Cognizance was taken by the learned Magistrate. The petitioner appeared before the learned Magistrate and was enlarged on bail. But subsequently the petitioner could not appear before the learned Magistrate allegedly on account of her illness. The learned Magistrate, reckoning her as absconding, has issued coercive processes against the petitioner. Consequently she finds herself in the unenviable predicament of warrants of arrest issued by the learned Magistrate chasing the petitioner. It is in these circumstances that the petitioner has come to this Court with this petition under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. According to the petitioner her absence was not willful.2. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is willing to appear before the learned Magistrate. But she apprehends that her application for bail may not be considered by the learned Magistrate on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously.It is in these circumstances prayed that appropriate directions may be issued to release the petitioner on bail on the date of surrender itself.3. It is certainly for the petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate and explain to the learned Magistrate the circumstances under which she could not earlier appear before the learned Magistrate. I have no reason to assume that the learned Magistrate would not consider the application for bail to be filed by the petitioner when she surrenders before the learned Magistrate, on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. Every court must do the same. No special or specific direction appears to be necessary. Sufficient general directions have already been issued by this Court in the decision in Alice George v. Dy.S.P. of Police (2003 (1) KLT 339)2003 (1) KLT 339.4. This application is accordingly dismissed. I may however hasten to observe that if the petitioner appears before the learned Magistrate and applies for bail after giving sufficient prior notice to the Prosecutor in charge of the case, the learned Magistrate must proceed to pass orders on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously - on the date of surrender itself.5. Hand over the order.Application dismissed"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.1, 60, 000/- (Rupees one lakh and sixty thousand only) within five months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.45, 000/- (Rupees forty five thousand only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall under go simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

The petitioner has been found guilty, convicted and sentenced in two separate prosecutions both under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The verdict of guilty, conviction and sentence have now become final with the orders passed by this court in two separate revision petitions. The sentences imposed on the petitioner have been indulgently modified in revision. He has been sentenced in both cases to undergo imprisonment till rising of court. He has been directed to pay compensation and in default to undergo imprisonment.2. The amount to be paid as compensation in each case is only the cheque amount. That is Rs.6, 00, 000/- and Rs.20, 00, 000/- respectively. The default sentence to be undergone in each case is S.I for a period of three months. The petitioner was granted time to appear before the learned Magistrate till 14/6/2006 and 15/09/2006. Though a long period of time has elapsed, the petitioner has not paid the amounts to avoid the default sentences.3. The petitioner has at this stage come to this court with a prayer that a direction may be issued for concurrent running of the default sentences imposed in the two cases. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner faces great financial difficulties and a direction for concurrency under Section 427 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is absolutely necessary. I shall assume for the sake of arguments that the default sentences can be directed to run concurrently in an appropriate case. But in the facts and circumstances of the cases referred above, I have absolutely no hesitation to hold that this is not a fit case where invoking the powers under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973, subsequent to the attainment finality of the orders in revision, this court must choose to direct concurrency of default sentence. No satisfactory reasons are shown to exist to justify such invocation of the extraordinary inherent jurisdiction. There is no failure or miscarriage of justice to prompt this court to invoke such jurisdiction.4. This petition is in these circumstances dismissed.Petition dismissed"

In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C. No.414/2003 on the file of the J.F.C.M.-II, Alappuzha challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.40, 000/- (Rupees forty thousand only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 2nd respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.60, 000/- (Rupees sixty thousand only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C. No.917/2001 on the file of the J.F.C.M., Irinjalakkuda challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 2nd respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.35, 000/- (Rupees thirty five thousand only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 2nd respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.1, 00, 000/- (Rupees one lakh only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court.

It is therefore prayed that directions under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 may be issued in favour of the petitioner.3. It is for the petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate and explain to the learned Magistrate the circumstances under which he could not earlier appear before the learned Magistrate. I have no reason to assume that the learned Magistrate would not consider such application on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. Every court must do the same. No special or specific direction appears to be necessary. Sufficient general directions have already been issued in Alice George v. The Deputy Superintendent of Police [2003(1) KLT 339]2003 (1) KLT 339.4. This Crl.M.C is, in these circumstances, dismissed, but with the specific observation that if the petitioner appears before the learned Magistrate and applies for bail after giving sufficient prior notice to the Prosecutor in charge of the case, the learned Magistrate must proceed to pass appropriate orders on merits and expeditiously - on the date of surrender itself.5. Hand over a copy of this order to the learned counsel for the petitioner.Order accordingly"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.35, 000/- (Rupees thirty five thousand only) [giving credit to a sum of Rs.10, 000/- (Rupees ten thousand only) deposited pursuant to the orders of the lower appellate court and which amount can be withdrawn by the 1st respondent complainant] within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.16, 000/- (Rupees sixteen thousand only) [giving credit to a sum of Rs.8, 000/- (Rupees eight thousand only) deposited before the trial court pursuant to orders of the first appellate court and which amount can be withdrawn by the 1st respondent complainant] within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

The short question involved in this appeal is whether it is necessary to prove that notice under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\") has been served on the first respondent - accused in the correct address?2. The appellant - complainant filed a complaint alleging that the first respondent herein committed offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act. The allegation in the complaint was that the first respondent - accused owed an amount of Rs.1, 00, 000/- to the complainant during 1995 in connection with the business transaction between them and that in discharge of the said amount, the accused issued Ext.P1 cheque dated 28.2.1995 in favour of the complainant which when presented to the bank for encashment was dishonoured for want of sufficient funds in the account of the accused. On receipt of intimation from the bank, the complainant caused a lawyer's notice on 7.9.1995, but the same was not accepted by the accused and hence, the complaint was filed. To prove the case against the accused, the complainant himself was examined as PW.1 and Exts.P1 to P7. No oral or documentary evidence was adduced on the side of the defence. On closure of the evidence of the complainant, the accused was questioned under Section 313 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. He denied the allegations levelled against him. After considering the evidence adducedby the complainant, the trial court found the accused guilty under Section 138 of the Act, convicted him there under and sentenced him to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one year. Against the above conviction and sentence, the first respondent - accused filed Crl. Appeal No.22 of 1997 before the Additional Sessions Court, North Paravur and the lower appellate court as per judgment dated 22.1.1997 set aside the judgment of the trial court and acquitted the accused on the ground that the complainant had not served notice to the accused in the correct address as contemplated under clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act.To come to this conclusion, the lower appellate court relied on the endorsement \" no such address\" made by the postal authority on Ext.P6 and stated that no complaint can be filed by the complainant before complying with the provisions under clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act. Against the finding of the lower appellate court, this appeal is filed.3. It is the case of the appellant - complainant that the first respondent - accused had not disputed the execution of the cheque or his signature contained in Ext.P1 cheque. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant submits that the acquittal of the accused on the basis of the endorsement made by the postal authority on Ext.P6 is not tenable. To substantiate this contention, learned counsel placed reliance on the judgment of this Court reported in Bhavani Auto Distributors v. Muraleedharan, 2007(3) I.L.R. Kerala 552007 (3) ILR(Ker) 55. In the above judgment, this Court had considered the purpose of serving notice under Section 138 of the Act. Reliance was also placed on the decision of the Apex Court reported in Rajneesh Aggarwal v, Amit J. Bhalla (2001) 1 S.C.C. 6312001 (1) SCC 6312001 ILO SC 20417 wherein the Apex Court held that the object of issuing notice under the provisions of the Act was to afford an opportunity to the drawer for making the payment. Further, it is the burden of the accused to prove that the notice sent to him was not sent in the correct address. There is also no evidence to show that the endorsement was made by the postal authority on the basis of any enquiry. It is possible that the accused might have requested the postal authority to make such an endorsement. The accused also has no case that the address in the notice was not his correct address.It has also come out in evidence that the summons sent to the accused from the lower court in C.C. No.1033 of 1993 was also in the same address. In the above circumstances, the conclusion arrived at by the lower appellate court is not legally tenable. Apart from the above, the Apex Court in the latest judgment reported in Alavi Haji, C.C. v. Palapetty Muhammed, 2007(3) I.L.R. Kerala 2032007 (3) ILR(Ker) 203 considered this point and held in paragraph 15 of the judgment that \"when notice is sent by registered post by correctly addressing the drawer of the cheque, the mandatory requirement of issue of notice in terms of Clause (b) of proviso to Section 138 of the Act stands complied with\".The Apex Court further held that \"it is then for the drawer to rebut the presumption about the service of notice and show that he had no knowledge that the notice was brought to his address or that the address mentioned on the cover was incorrect or that the letter was never tendered or that the report of the postman was incorrect.\"4. In the light of the dictum laid down by the Apex Court in the above judgment, it can be concluded that the only purpose of service of notice to the accused is to make him aware of the dishonour of the cheque. Further, the lower appellate court ought to have considered whether the endorsement made by the postal authority was true or not. In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the judgment of the lower appellate court has to be set aside. Accordingly, the judgment of the lower appellate court in Crl. Appeal No.22 of 1997 is set aside and the matter is remanded to the court below for fresh consideration. The lower appellate court shall dispose of the matter as expeditiously as possible, at any rate with three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. The parties shall also appear before the lower appellate court.The Crl. Appeal is allowed by way of remand.Appeal allowed"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE K. R. UDAYABHANU1. The appellant is the complainant in the proceedings initiated under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 in which the accused has been acquitted.2. It is the case of the complainant/appellant that on 5.10.1998 the impugned cheque for Rs.73, 215/- was issued by the accused towards discharge of debt due to the complainant and that the same when presented got dishonoured for want of funds in the account of the accused. The lawyer notice sent demanding payment was not replied to.3. The evidence adduced in the matter consisted of the testimony of PW1 and Exts. P1 to P7. The defence got examined DW1 and marked Exts. D1 to D13.4. PW1, the complainant has testified in proof of the execution of the cheque. He has also proved the documents in support that included the dishonour memo, intimation, lawyer notice, postal acknowledgment and ledger extract. The defence case put in the cross examination of PW1 is that the complainant was running a financial institution by name Vettom Bankers and that in the chitty run by the above institution, the father of the accused was a subscriber and the accused as guarantor for the chitty bid by the father of the accused he issued the blank cheque to the complainant's institution. PW1 has denied the suggestion that he is conducting any chitty business. According to him, he provided the loan to the accused as he is a neighbour.Although, not stated by PW1 when DW2, the accused was examined the suggestion is that the amount was given to PW1 in 3 instalments.5. In order to prove the evidence of PW1, the defence examined DWs' 1 to 5 including DW2, the accused and DW5, the father of the accused. DW1 is one Father Kurian who has stated that it was at his instance that the accused was persuaded to issue the cheque as guarantee to the Vettom Bankers. He has stated that he happened to see the father of the accused quarreling with the accused as he was not amenable to issue the cheque and that he managed to get the cheque from the accused and gave it to the father of the accused. DW4 is the independent witness who was examined to prove that the Vettom Bankers are conducting the chitty. He has produced Ext. D5 series receipts and Ext. D6 calendar of Vettom Bankers. As pointed out by the counsel for the appellant Ext. D5 series did not contain the name Vettom Bankers and that of the complainant. I find that it is not specifically put to DW4 that the complainant is not running any chitty transaction. DW5, the father of the accused, has testified in support of the case set up by the accused. Of course, the court below has noted that the accused had attempted to create evidence by erasing address written in Ext. D8 certificate of posting by which Ext. D9 is said to have been sent to the complainant. According to DW2, the accused, he had issued letter demanding the return of the cheque vide Ext. D1 postal receipt and Ext. D2 postal acknowledgments. But the copy of the letter could not be produced. He has also stated that he had filed a complaint before the Circle Inspector of Police of the area and before the Revenue Minister vide Ext. D12. It is also noted by the court below that as can be seen from Ext. D3 ledger extract of the account of the accused the cheques having serial numbers 881, 882 and 883 were presented to the bank and encashed on 5.7.1995, 22.2.1996 and 29.7.1996 respectively. The impugned cheque is having the last digits as 884. Cheque Nos.885 and 886 were encashed on 30.12.1996 and 7.5.1998 respectively. The alleged borrowal in the instant case is on 5.2.1998 which is also the date of the cheque. I find that the above clearly shed light as to the truth of the case set up by the defence. It is unlikely that such a huge amount would have been given to a person in instalments without obtaining any document especially by a person who is running a finance out fit and also that the cheque having serial No.884 as last digits would have been kept away for issuing in October 1998. In view of the above evidence adduced in the matter, I find that there is no scope for interference in the finding of the court below.The appeal is dismissed.Appeal dismissed"

It is also directed that the fine amount, if realised, an amount of Rs.20, 000/- is to be paid to the complainant as compensation.2. The prosecution case is that the complainant has paid a sum of Rs.20, 000/- to the accused as he promised to obtain her a job at Guruvayoorappan College, Kozhikode and as he could not arrange for the job towards the discharge of the liability he issued the impugned cheque which when presented for encashment got dishonoured for want of funds in the account of the accused. The execution of the cheque and dishonour for want of funds stands proved from the evidence of PW1. The lawyer notice sent was not replied to nor was the amount paid. Both the courts below have concurrently found that the execution of the cheque stands proved as well as the insufficiency of funds in the account of the accused. There was no rebuttal evidence. In the circumstances, I find no reason to interfere in the findings of the courts below.3. All the same, considering the plea of the counsel for the revision petitioner, the sentence is modified to imprisonment till the rising of the court and to pay a compensation of Rs.20, 000/- to PW1, the complainant, and in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for three months. The revision petitioner is granted two months' time to remit the amount of compensation. He shall appear before the court of JFCM-I, Kozhikode on 28.9.2007 to receive sentence.The criminal revision petition is disposed of accordingly.Petition disposed of"

In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C. No.525/2003 on the file of the J.F.C.M., Varkala challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against her for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice.4. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner contended that the statutory notice was not issued in the correct address of the revision petitioner accused who was actually residing in Shahana Manzil, Sreyat, Edava, Thiruvananthapuram whereas the notice was issued at Vilayil veedu @ Painkulam Vayalil veedu, Manthara, Edava. The address of the revision petitioner shown in the complaint is the same address to which the statutory notice was issued. In the appeal filed by the revision petitioner before the lower appellate court, the very same address was shown. It is only for the first time in this revision that she has deliberately changed her address. Hence the contention that notice was issued in wrong address cannot be countenanced at all. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding.The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.5. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided she complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.2, 50, 000/- (Rupees two lakhs and fifty thousand only) within six months from today, then she need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, she shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE V. RAMKUMAR1. In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in C.C. No.623/2002 on the file of the J.F.C.M.-I, Thrissur challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice.4. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner submitted that the cheque in question was a signed blank cheque kept for the purpose of being given to customers while purchasing copra and the complainant who was given employment under the father of the accused was misusing the same. In the first place, this is a version which was emphatically denied by the complainant examined as PW1. Secondly, both the courts did not accept the said defence. It is opposed to human conduct for a person to keep signed blank cheques to be handed over on a future date to customers. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.5. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. The cheque amount is Rs.1, 50, 000/-. The cheque was issued in the year 1998. Giving allowance to the efflux of time the compensation fixed by the court below was Rs.1, 75, 000/-. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner would submit that he had deposited Rs.25, 000/- before the trial court pursuant to the orders of the first appellate court and another sum of Rs.50, 000/- pursuant to orders of this court. If he has already deposited Rs.75, 000/- what remains is Rs.1, 00, 000/- (Rupees one lakh only) which he shall pay to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 within five months from today. If he pays the balance amount as aforesaid then he need undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If he commits default in the payment, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months. If no amount is deposited before the trial court, the liability of the petitioner shall be Rs.1, 75, 000/- as fixed by the court below.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided she complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.45, 000/- (Rupees forty five thousand only) [giving credit to the sum of Rs.25, 000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only) deposited by the revision petitioner before the trial court and which amount can be withdrawn by the 1st respondent complainant] within four months from today, then she need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, she shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

The petitioner had not appeared before the learned Magistrate. Consequently, from 10/2/2004, a non-bail able warrant issued by the learned Magistrate is chasing the petitioner. According to the petitioner, he is absolutely innocent. His absence earlier was not wilful or deliberate. The petitioner is willing to surrender before the learned Magistrate and seek regular bail. But he apprehends that his application for bail may not be considered by the learned Magistrate on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. He, therefore, prays that directions under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 may be issued to the learned Magistrate to release the petitioner on bail when he appears and applies for bail.2. It is for the petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate and explain to the learned Magistrate, the circumstances under which he could not earlier appear before the learned Magistrate. I find absolutely no reason to assume that the learned Magistrate would not consider the application for bail to be filed by the petitioner on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. Every court must do the same. No special or specific directions appear to be necessary. Sufficient general directions have been issued in Alice George vs. Deputy Superintendent of Police [2003(1)KLT 339]2003 (1) KLT 339.3. In the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is dismissed but with the specific observation that if the petitioner surrenders before the learned Magistrate and applies for bail, after giving sufficient prior notice to the Prosecutor in charge of the case, the learned Magistrate must proceed to pass appropriate orders on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously - on the date of surrender itself.Order accordingly"

In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in S.T. No.879/2004 on the file of the J.F.C.M.-II, Pathanamthitta challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.30, 000/- (Rupees thirty thousand only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence.

The case was posted for hearing to 16.08.07. On that date, the petitioner could not appear. A warrant of arrest has been issued against the petitioner. She finds such warrant chasing her. The case is now posted to 18.09.07.2. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is absolutely innocent. Her absence before court on 16.08.07 was not wilful and was on account of reasons beyond her control. The petitioner is wiling to surrender before the learned Magistrate and seek regular bail. But she apprehends that before she is able to surrender before the learned Magistrate, she may be taken into custody in execution of the non bailable warrant. She further apprehends that her application may not be considered by the learned Magistrate on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. It is therefore prayed that directions under Sections 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 may be issued in favour of the petitioner.3. After the decision in Bharat Chaudhary v. State of Bihar [A.I.R 2003 S.C 4662]2003 AIR(SC) 46622003 ILO SC 821, it is well settled that powers under Section 438 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 can be invoked even in favour of an accused who apprehends arrest in execution of a non bailable warrant issued in a pending proceedings. But even for that, sufficient and satisfactory reasons must be shown to exist to justify the invocation of the extraordinary equitable discretion under Section 438 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 I do not find any such reasons in this case.4. It is for the petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate and explain to the learned Magistrate the circumstances under which she could not earlier appear before the learned Magistrate. I have no reason to assume that the learned Magistrate would not consider such application on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. Every court must do the same. No special or specific direction appears to be necessary. Sufficient general directions have already been issued in Alice George v. The Deputy Superintendent of Police [2003(1) KLT 339]2003 (1) KLT 339.5. This Crl.M.C is, in these circumstances, dismissed, but with the specific observation that if the petitioner appears before the learned Magistrate and applies for bail after giving sufficient prior notice to the Prosecutor in charge of the case, the learned Magistrate must proceed to pass appropriate orders on merits and expeditiously - on the date of surrender itself. There shall be a further direction that the warrant of arrest ordered to be issued on 16.08.07 shall not be executed till 18.09.07. On or before that date the petitioner has to surrender and seek regular bail.Order accordingly"

The prosecution case is that the accused borrowed a sum of Rs.40, 000/- from the complainant and issued the impugned cheque which when presented got dishonoured for want of funds in the account of the accused. Lawyer notice sent was not replied to nor was the amount repaid.3. The evidence adduced in the matter consisted of the testimony of PWs 1 to 3 and Exts.P1 to P7. PW-1 is the complainant. He has proved the execution of the cheque. PWs 2 and 3, the bank managers, have proved the fact that the account of the accused did not contain sufficient cash to honour the cheque. No rebuttal evidence was adduced.4. In the circumstances and in view of the concurrent findings of the courts below, I find no reason to interfere in the findings of the courts below. The conviction is confirmed.5. Considering the plea of the counsel for the revision petitioner, the sentence is modified to imprisonment till the rising of the court. Rest of the sentence is confirmed. Revision petitioner is granted two months time from today onwards to pay the amount. The revision petitioner shall appear before the JFCM, Chavakkad on 25-9-2007 to receive the sentence.The Crl.R.P is disposed of accordingly.Petition disposed of"

He had no information about the pending proceedings. The petitioner is willing to surrender before the learned Magistrate and co-operate with the court for the early disposal of the case. But he apprehends that his application for anticipatory bail may not be considered by the learned Magistrate on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. He, therefore, prays that directions under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 may be issued to the learned Magistrate to release the petitioner on bail when he appears and applies for bail.2. It is for the petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate and explain to the learned Magistrate, the circumstances under which he could not earlier appear before the learned Magistrate.3. I find absolutely no reason to assume that the learned Magistrate would not consider the application for bail to be filed by the petitioner on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously.

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding.The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.1, 35, 000/- (Rupees one lakh and thirty five thousand only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding.The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned. Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the 1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357 (3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a sum of Rs.75, 000/- (Rupees seventy five thousand only) within three months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till the rising of the court. If on the other hand, the revision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence. Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the revision petitioner.This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Revision disposed of"

The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the revision petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition hereinafter mentioned.

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE R. BASANT1. Was the learned Magistrate justified in invoking his jurisdiction to award costs in the facts and circumstances of this Case? When adjournment is sought on the ground that the counsel had taken ill all of a sudden, can or should that jurisdiction be invoked to award costs, the panacea for all evils to a non party/stranger - even when such non-party/stranger is the Legal Services Authority? Thoughts on these aspects are aroused in this Criminal Miscellaneous Case.2. The petitioner is the accused in a prosecution under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 filed in 2006. The case was posted for trial to 11/9/2007. The learned counsel for the petitioner took ill suddenly and had to be taken to the hospital. It is submitted that the counsel was ready to go on with the trial but for his taking ill all of a sudden and unexpectedly. The counsel could not conduct the trial on that day. The matter was reported to the learned. Magistrate. The learned Magistrate made the endorsement that there is no cross-examination for the petitioner and adjourned the case. Later, an application was filed to recall the complainant for cross-examination: The impugned order shows that no objections were raised by the learned counsel for the complainant. The learned Magistrate however proceeded to pass the impugned order directing payment of an amount of Rs.500/- as costs to the Legal Services Authority. The petitioner claims to be aggrieved by the impugned order.3. I have not ordered notice to the respondent/complainant as the impugned order clearly shows that the learned counsel for the complainant had not raised any objections against the prayer to recall the complainant for cross-examination. That appears to be evident from the further fact that cost has been ordered to be paid not to the complainant but to the Legal Services Authority.4. The counsel are officers of the court and if the circumstances are true, any court must have certainly permitted adjournment of cross-examination of the complainant. When a counsel is reported to have taken ill suddenly and taken to the hospital, it certainly is for the court to take note of that circumstance and act accordingly. The counsel have no other method of applying to excuse their absence. Officers and staff can of course apply for casual leave and leave the court. Counsel will have to make such representations before court. On facts there is no dispute that the counsel had taken ill on that day and Annexure A2 medical record clearly shows the correctness and acceptability of that submission. I accept that he had taken ill unexpectedly and all of a sudden before he could start the cross-examination.5. The jurisdiction to award costs stems from the need to compensate the adversary for the loss and inconvenience suffered on account of the conduct -contumacious or otherwise, of a litigant. Of course incidentally the jurisdiction draws support for its very existence to the need to discipline and chastise the contumacious litigant. That dimension of the jurisdiction to award costs must also be alertly perceived. From the impugned order, I find neither aspect to be available in this case.6. Further I do not, in the facts and circumstances of this case, find any justification in the direction for payment of costs to the Legal Services Authority. Courts have to be careful while directing payment of costs to a non party/stranger even when such stranger is the State or the Legal Services Authority. In a situation like this where the Legal Services Authority does not at all come into the picture in the dispute that is raised, I am at a loss to understand why a direction has been made for payment of costs to the Legal Services Authority. Obviously because the learned counsel for the complainant did not raise any objection realizing the plight of the learned counsel for the petitioner, such a direction appears to have been issued.7. There may be rare instances when the conscience of the court is satisfied that parties or their counsel are collusi vely draining the time of the court or attempting to callously prolong the proceedings to the detriment of any non party, State or the Court itself. In such cases it may not be impossible to sustain a direction for payment of costs to the non party State or Legal Services Authority. But compelling and sufficient reasons and circumstances must be shown to exist before such a direction is issued. In an exceptional and fit case, adjournment of the case on account of genuine reasons attributable to the counsel may also result in undeserved hardship to the unfortunate adversary. It is possible that the court may be compelledjustifiably to award costs to such adversary also. I am unable to perceive any such circumstances in the facts of this case. But heartless and mechanical issue of directions for payment of costs to the non party Legal Services Authority, which trend I find is on the increase, has to be frowned, upon. That explains this detailed order in this case. Judicial officers wearing the mantle of Legal Services Authority functionaries handle its funds and that is all the more reason to insist on very good reasons to justify such directions. Making justice appear to be done also is indeed a very onerous responsibility. No negative impression or messages, even unintented or unjustified should be conveyed. No room for such impression should be left.8. I am certainly satisfied that the impugned order warrants interference. Court below does not appear to have imbibed the fundamental concept that the counsel is an officer of the court and genuine grievance of the counsel must be taken care of by the court when representations to that effect are made and there is no dispute of the facts. Counsel are and ought to be partners in the sublime judicial process of ascertaining truth and justice. A sense of alienation from the process in the mind of the counsel would be at the peril of the sublime judicial process and the very system of which the bench and the bar are the vital and equal constituents.6. This Criminal Miscellaneous Case is in these circumstances allowed. The impugned order is set aside. The petitioner shall be granted opportunity to cross-examine the complainant without any terms.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE R. BASANT1. The petitioner has been found guilty, convicted and sentenced in a prosecution under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The verdict of guilty, conviction and sentence have now become final with the order passed by this Court in revision. The opportunity given by the revisional Court was not taken advantage and the matter was not settled. Long later, the petitioner has come before this Court now along with the complainant to advance a contention that there has been a subsequent settlement of the dispute between the parties. The petitioner wants this Court to invoke the jurisdiction under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to quash the sentence imposed on him. The sentence imposed on the petitioner is the substantive sentence of imprisonment till rising of Court. There is a further direction to pay an amount of Rs.75, 000/- as compensation and in default to undergo S.I. for aperiod of three months.2. The learned counsel for the petitioner and the complainant, who are both before me, submit that the entire compensation amount has been paid and discharged and no further amount is claimed towards compensation. If that be so, there can be no question of executing the default sentence. The position has been made very clear in the decision in Girish v. Muthoot Capital Services (P) Ltd. (2007 (1) KLT 16)2007 (1) KLT 162006 ILO KER 69. What remains is only the substantive sentence of imprisonment till rising of Court. Sabu George v. Home Secretary (2007 (1) KLT 982)2007 (1) KLT 9822007 ILO KER 30 is not authority for the proposition that all post-revision compositions can be accepted invoking the powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. That was an exceptional case where the accused would have been compelled to undergo incarceration for a long period of time inspite of the settlement. Posed with that situation, this Court took the view that that was an ideal situation in which the inherent powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 can and ought to be invoked.3. The dictum in Sabu George cannot be understood to mean that any and all post-revision compositions can hereafter be valid and can be accepted. I do not find any reason to invoke the powers under S.482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 in this case with the aid of the dictum in Sabu George. It is for the petitioner/accused and the respondent/ complainant to satisfy the learned Magistrate that the entire compensation amount has been paid and there is no further liability to pay any amount of compensation. The direction was only \" to pay the compensation\" and not to deposit the compensation amount. In these circumstances, if a joint submission is made that the entire compensation amount has been paid and that liability has been discharged and nothing remains to be paid, there can be no question of the learned Magistrate executing the default sentence.4. This Crl. M.C. is accordingly dismissed. If the liability to pay compensation has been discharged, the petitioner shall be liable only to undergo the substantive sentence of imprisonment till rising of Court.5. Hand over the order.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE R. BASANT1. Is it invariable that the complainant must appear in person before a Court to file a complaint ? If the complainant is not personally present, will the Magistrate be justified in not receiving the complaint at all ? Is it possible for the Magistrate to receive the complaint and post the case for recording the sworn statement to a later date after condoning the absence of the complainant on the date of presentation ? In a case like S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 where the personal presence of the complainant is not necessary for recording the sworn statement under S.200 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and an affidavit in its place has been filed under S. 145 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, is it at all necessary for the Magistrate to insist on the personal appearance of the complainant/his attorney ? These are the questions that arise for consideration in these Crl.M.Cs.2. The common petitioner - H.D.F.C Ltd. is the complainant in 2 separate prosecutions - both before the learned Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-I, Kannur. The prosecutions are initiated under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The complaints were presented before the learned Magistrate by the counsel for the petitioner. The petitioner is an incorporated body. An officer of the petitioner company, who is authorised under a deed of power of attorney, has filed the complaints in the name of the petitioner company. Both complaints were presented along with applications to condone the delay in filing the complaints. When the complaints were presented, the power of attorney holder of the petitioner was not personally present. He made applications to condone his absence on the date of presentation. Those petitions were rejected. The complaints were returned to the complainant's counsel for later presentation. Aggrieved by the course adopted by the learned Magistrate, the petitioner has come before this Court.3. A complaint is defined under S.2(d) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 as follows:\"Complaint means any allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate, with a view to his taking action under this Code, that some person, whether known or unknown, has committed an offence, but-does not include a police report.\" (emphasis supplied)Such a complaint can either be oral or in writing. So far as the complaint under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is concerned, in view of S. 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the complaint has got to be in writing. The first question is whether the complainant must be present in person to prefer the complaint. The learned counsel for the petitioner Sri.Ziyad Rahman contends that there is no stipulation anywhere in law which makes it obligatory for the complainant to appear in person to present the complaint. With limitation having been prescribed for filing the complaint under Chapter XXXVI of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 a rigid insistence on the personal appearance of the complainant would work out great hardship, prejudice and inconvenience to the complainants at least in some cases, ujges counsel. In a case where sworn statement of the complainant under S.200 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 need not be recorded at all, there is absolutely no warrant for insistence on the personal appearance of the complainant at the pre-cognizance stage, contends the counsel.4. The contention raised is interesting and a matter of daily occurrence and relevance in criminal courts. The learned counsel for the petitioner was hence requested to advance detailed arguments. Cognizance can be taken by a criminal court in one of the 3 modes permitted under S.190 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. It can be on receiving a complaint of facts; it can be upon a police report of such facts or it can be upon information received from any person other than a police officer or upon knowledge of the Magistrate. What is significant according to me is that S. 190 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 does not any where expressly or by necessary implication suggest or insist that such a complaint can be presented only personally by a complainant by appearing in court.5. Of course in a normal complaint in which recording the sworn statement under S.200 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is necessary, the complainant will normally have to appear before the learned Magistrate as such statement will have to be recorded to proceed to the next. stage of enquiry. But what is of relevance is that even in S.200 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 there is no mandate that the complainant must appear personally on the date of presentation of the complaint. When the complaint is presented, the next step, if the complaint is not referred under S. 156(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is to record the sworn statement of the complainant. I have gone through S.200 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 as also the other stipulations in Chapter XV. I am unable to spell out a rigid insistence under the Code that the complainant must be present personally to present a complaint as defined under S.2(d) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 before the learned Magistrate for the Magistrate to take cognizance. To save limitation, it is certainly possible for the complainant to appear through pleader and present the complaint and seek condonation or his absence and leave to appear on a later date to record sworn statement. In an appropriate case, a Magistrate can certainly condone the absence of the complainant and direct him to appear personally on a later date for recording the sworn statement under S.200 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 19736. But in a prosecution under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, even that does not appear to be necessary. The complaint has got to be in writing as insisted by S. 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The requirement of recording sworn statement of the complainant under S.200 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is there in a complaint under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 also. But S. 145 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 clearly shows that evidence of a complainant can be given on affidavit. The question did come up for detailed consideration in Vasudevan v. State of Kerala (2005(1) KLT 220)2005 (1) KLT 220, and it was held that proceedings under S.200 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is inquiry and an affidavit by a complainant can be received in the place of sworn statement to be recorded under S.200 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 19737. If that be so, the presence of the complainant becomes not necessary for recording the sworn statement under S.200 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 Of course, if the case falls under the just exceptions under S. 145 Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the Magistrate undoubtedly has jurisdictional competence to insist on personal appearance of the complainant. But otherwise it does not appear to me to be necessary to insist on personal appearance of the complainant invariably in all cases when complaint is presented.8. Though not specifically for consideration of this aspect, the observations made in para. 16 and 17 of Vasudevan (supra) also throw light on this aspect.Para. 16: Thus, it follows from the above discussions that the proceedings before the Criminal Court at a stage prior to S.203/204 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 will be inquiry. The statement of a complainant to be recorded under S.200 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 will be evidence. In these circumstances. S.145 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 squarely applies and it will be permissible for the Court to receive the affidavit filed under S. 145 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 at the stage of S.200 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and to act upon the same. It is unnecessary ordinarily to insist on personal appearance of the complainant to tender the sworn statement at that stage.Para. 17:1 have no hesitation to opine that the Courts are obliged to follow that course. The Parliament and the working group set up by the Parliament had come to the conclusion that preliminary evidence can be recorded by receiving evidence on affidavit without insisting on personal appearance and examination of the complainant. The Legislature was prescribing a remedy for a malady which it perceived. Courts cannot insist that the complainant must appear before Court and tender sworn statement in all cases. Such insistence would certainly run counter to the mandate of S. 145 of the N.I Act. The purpose of S. 138 of the N.I. Act would be stultified and frustrated if there is no expeditious disposal of the complaints under S. 138 of the N.I Act. The Legislature had permitted reception of affidavits by complainants as evidence in prosecutions under S.138 of the N.I Act to achieve that result. It is therefore imperative, unless the case on hand falls within the \"just exception\" contemplated under S. 145 of the N.I Act that the Criminal Courts must receive affidavits as evidence at the stage of S.200 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 also and should not insist on personal appearance and examination of the complainant to give sworn statement\".9. As the law of limitation is applicable to criminal cases also, a complainant is bound to present the complaint within the stipulated period of time. If within the stipulated period of time a complainant is not able to appear in person and present the complaint, according to me, there is nothing in law which prohibits the presentation of the complaint in court through counsel. Of course, I repeat that in an appropriate case, the learned Magistrate can insist on personal appearance to record the sworn statement under S.200 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. In a prosecution under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, if the case comes within the just exception under S. 145 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the learned Magistrate can direct the complainant to appear on a later date. But at any rate, the insistence that the complainant must appear in person to present the complaint invariably in all cases does not appear to be justified.10. In the facts of the instant case, the complainant is a company. The company cannot appear in person being an incorporated fictitious legal person. Such a company files complaints through the power of attorney holder of the company. It appears to me to be absolutely unnecessary in such a case to insist on the personal appearance of the attorney of the company to make the presentation of the complaint valid and legal.11. The above discussions lead me to the conclusion that the insistence made by the learned Magistrate is not justified. Petitioner shall be at liberty to represent the complaint before the learned Magistrate and the learned Magistrate must receive the complaint without insisting on the personal appearance of the complainant ie. the attorney of the company. This of course is subject to the exception that if found necessary under S. 145 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the person who has sworn to the affidavit can be directed to appear.12. The complainant shall re-present the complaint before the learned Magistrate within a period of 15 days from this date in which event, it shall be reckoned that the learned Magistrate had issued a direction under R.68 of the Kerala Criminal Rules of Practice to represent the complaint and such representation shall refer back to the date of original presentation.13. This Crl.M.C. is allowed with the above observations.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE R. BASANT1. The petitioner faces indictment in a prosecution under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Proceedings were initiated as early as in 2002. The case has at last reached the stage of defence evidence. The petitioner filed an application to send the cheque to the handwriting expert. That application was opposed by the complainant. The learned Magistrate, by the impugned order, a copy of which is produced as Annexure-C, dismissed the application holding that there is no bona fides and the attempt is only to drag on the proceedings.2. Admittedly, the cheque is one issued in an account maintained by the petitioner with his bank. Admittedly, it bears the signature of the accused. Admittedly, the cheque is handed over by the accused to the complainant. Admittedly, it was handed over with the intention that the cheque can be presented for encashment. What then is the contention? The learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the blank signed cheque was handed over the same to the complainant with the intention that he may hand over to someone else to avail a loan for himself. It was never intended or contemplated that the complainant would enter his own name as a payee. This, in short, is the crux of the contention.3. It is also vitally relevant to note that the notice of demand did not admittedly evoke any response. It is in this background that at the defence stage the petition was filed to forward the cheque to the expert.4. The law is trite that any and every request to forward the cheque to the expert need not be blindly and meekly accepted by the learned Magistrate. S.254(2) of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 makes the position crystal clear. Only if the Magistrate thinks it fit, need the cheque be forwarded to the expert who is to be examined as a defence witness.5. I shall carefully and scrupulously avoid any authentic finding on disputed facts at this stage. I must alertly remind myself of the nature, quality and contours of the jurisdiction which I am called upon to invoke and exercise. It is the extraordinary inherent jurisdiction which this Court must invoke and exercise. Any and every error committed by a subordinate Court even assuming that there is any such error will not by itself persuade this Court to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction. Is there failure/ miscarriage of justice? Is there abuse of process of the Court? These are the crucial questions that come up for consideration.6. Without in any way intending to fetter the rights of the petitioner to raise appropriate contentions before the Trial Court or the appellate or revisional courts, I need only observe that I am not satisfied that there is any such vice or defect in the impugned order which would justify this Court invoking the extraordinary inherent jurisdiction under S.482 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973.7. This petition is accordingly dismissed. At the risk of repetition, it is made clear that the dismissal of this petition will not, in any way, fetter the rights of the petitioner to raise all appropriate contentions including a challenge against the impugned order at appropriate later stages.Petition dismissed"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE V. RAMKUMAR1. The Revision Petitioner, who is the complainant in S.T. No. 143/06 on the file of JFCM-II, Haripad, challenges the order dated 5.2.2007 passed by the said Magistrate returning the complaint presumably under S .201 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for presenting the same before the proper court having jurisdiction within two weeks.2. The above private complaint was filed against the first respondent-accused alleging the commission of an offence punishable under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 in respect of a cheque bearing No.509004 drawn on the Pallickal Branch of the State Bank of India for a sum of Rs. 1, 00, 000/- allegedly issued by the accused to discharge his liability towards a loan said to have been availed by him from the revision petitioner/complainant.3. The learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offence and recorded the sworn statement of the complainant and took the case on file as S.T. No. 143/2006. On receipt of summons, the accused entered appearance. The trial of the case was later on commenced. After the evidence in the case was over, the accused was examined under S.313 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the case was posted for arguments when the first respondent accused, for the first time, raised a contention that the said Magistrate lacks territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try the complaint since the place where the revision petitioner complainant is residing and the place where the cheque was presented and the place where the accused is residing are not within the local limits of the JFCM-II, Haripad. The objection regarding jurisdiction was raised on the basis that merely because the place of issuance of notice to the accused was within the local limits of the Haripad court would not clothe that court to entertain and try the case. Admittedly, the statutory notice was issued from a place within the local limits of the jurisdiction the JFCM-II, Haripad.4. The learned Magistrate relying on the decision reported in Ahammedkutty Haji v. State of Kerala (2007 (1) KLT 68)2007 (1) KLT 682006 ILO KER 75 and Hariharaputhra Sharma v. State of Kerala (2007 (1) KLT SN 432007 (1) KLT 43 (C.No.60) = 2006 (3) KLJ 875)2006 (3) KLJ 875 took the view that the decision of the Apex Court in K. Bhaskaran v. Sankaran Vaidhyan Balan & Anr. (1999 (3) KLT 4401999 (3) KLT 4401999 ILO SC 755 (SC) = 1999 (7) SCC 510)1999 (7) SCC 5101999 ILO SC 755 had been distinguished in the later decisions of this court and accordingly came to the conclusion that since both the accused as well as the complainant are residing outside the jurisdiction of the court below and the cheque was presented as well as dishonoured at places outside the local limits of the court below and the drawee bank was also located beyond the limits of the court below, that court had no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the complaint merely because the lawyer who issued the statutory notice had his office at Haripad within the local limits of the court below. Accordingly, the complaint was returned with a direction to present it before the proper court having jurisdiction. It is the said order which is assailed by the revision petitioner.5. Even though the first respondent accused was duly served, he has not chosen to enter appearance or oppose this revision.6. First of all, going by the decision of the Apex court in Bhaskaran 's case, if the giving of notice in writing to the drawer of the cheque demanding payment took place within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the court when the complaint was filed, then that court can entertain and try the complaint. Even assuming that the court below did not possess the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the complaint for the reasons stated by that court, it is pertinent to note that the objection regarding territorial jurisdiction was raised only at the fag end of the trial and that too for the first time when the arguments were heard. Even though there is no provision in Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 analogous to one contained in S.21 of the Code Of Civil Procedure, 1908, the preponderance of judicial opinion is to the effect that if an objection regarding territorial jurisdiction has not been raised at the earliest opportunity, then it will not be entertained by the court. The position is almost analogous to what is obtained under S.21 Code Of Civil Procedure, 1908. In Ramanujan Nair v. Sarojini (1970 KLT 645)1970 KLT 645 the question arose before the Trial Court as to whether it had territorial jurisdiction under S. 177 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to entertain the complaint. The objection regarding jurisdiction was raised only at the fag end of the trial. The accused did not raise the objection regarding want of territorial jurisdiction until the entire prosecution evidence was over. This is what the Division Bench observed in that decision :-\"4. S.177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that every offence shall ordinarily be inquired into and tried by a court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the offence was committed. The contention now is that the second marriage, the offence in the present case, was committed within the local limits of the Quilon court and since the complaint was filed in the Trivandrum court, the latter court has no territorial jurisdiction to try the offence. The Supreme Court has said in Narumal's case that the word 'ordinarily' in S.177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure means \"except where provided otherwise in the Code\". From this it is contended by the counsel of the petitioner that since there is no other provision contra in the Code or even in any other law the proper court having jurisdiction to try the case is the court which should ordinarily try the case, namely, the court at Quilon. In the other decision of the Supreme Court the salutary principle behind S. 177 is pointed out. The Supreme Court has pointed out that the jurisdiction of courts for trial of offences is of two kinds, one regarding the power of the courts to try particular kinds of offences and the other what is called territorial jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has also pointed out that the former type of jurisdiction goes to the root of the matter, and if a court not empowered to try a particular offence does; try it, the entire trial is void, and that such importance is not attached to lack of territorial jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has pointed out further that territorial jurisdiction is \"a matter of convenience, keeping in mind the administrative point of view with respect to the work of a particular court, the convenience of the accused who will have to meet the charge levelled against him and the convenience of the witnesses who have to appear before the court\". Thus the Supreme Court has pointed out, S.177 lays down a rule which doss not go to the root of the matter and which does not make the trial by a court having no territorial jurisdiction a nullity. It is not as if the Additional First Class Magistrate's Court at Trivandrum is lacking in jurisdiction to try a case under S.494 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860: the lack of jurisdiction is only because the alleged second marriage is said to have taken place outside its territorial jurisdiction. In other words, the Trivandrum court has no lack of inherent jurisdiction to try an offence of the kind, but its lack of jurisdiction is only lack of territorial jurisdiction.5. In the special circumstances we have already pointed out at the commencement of this judgment, namely, that the petitioner did not take the objection of lack of territorial jurisdiction until the entire prosecution evidence was over and even until four of the five accused persons were discharged, we feel that this case may be taken out of the expression \"ordinarily\" in S. 177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner has not even alleged that he is prejudiced by the trial being continued before the court at Trivandrum: in fact, the circumstances pointed out at the bar indicate that the trial of the case in the Trivandrum court might probably be more convenient to the petitioner.\"7. The court below was not justified in entertaining the objection regarding territorial jurisdiction at the belated stage as aforesaid especially when no prejudice was pleaded or proved. The impugned order dated 5.2.07 is accordingly set aside and JFCM-II, Haripad is directed to proceed with S.T.No. 143/06 and dispose it of in accordance with law.This revision is allowed as above.Revision allowed"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE R. BASANT1. The petitioner was the accused in a prosecution under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. He allegedly owed amounts to a person -1 shall refer to him as 'the principal'. To discharge that liability to the principal, the petitioner allegedly issued a cheque to the respondent herein - the Power-of-Attorney holder of the principal. The Attorney, in his own name, initiated proceedings under S.I 38 of the N.I. Act as he was the payee as per the cheque. He explained the issue of the cheque in his name by contending that he was the attorney of the principal and in proof of that produced the instrument of Power-of-Attorney. That instrument is attested by a Notary Public at Calcutta. That instrument of the Power-of-Attorney and the Notarial certificate are produced before me as Annexure-II. In the course of examination, the attorney asserted that he had never gone to Calcutta to obtain the instrument of Power-of-Attorney. The petitioner contended before the Trial Court, the Appellate Court and the Re visional Court that he had not committed the offence under S.I38 of the N.I. Act. That contention was not accepted by the Trial Court, the Appellate Court and the Revisional Court. The petitioner has now been found guilty, convicted and sentenced. The verdict of guilty, conviction and sentence have now become final. The Supreme Court has also not entertained the Special Leave Petition, it is submitted. While the revision petition was pending, the petitioner filed an application before the learned Magistrate to initiate proceedings under S.340 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. against the respondent/complainant. It was alleged that a false statement has been made by the complainant on oath. He had asserted that he had not gone to Calcutta to execute the deed of Power-of-Attdrney. But deed of Power-of-Attorney shows that a signature of the attorney bearing the date 5-1 -2002 is there in the document. It was further seen that the Notary had attested the document on 5-1-2002 at Calcutta. The petitioner relied on the presumption available and contended that the respondent must have been present at Calcutta on 05/01/2002 and his assertion contra on oath before the learned Magistrate is fals, e. Consequently, it was contended that proceedings for perjury must be initiated by the Court. The application was opposed. The learned Magistrate did not accept the said contention. An appeal was preferred. The learned Sessions Judge has dismissed the said appeal also now. In view of S.341(2) of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 no revision lies and that explains why the petitioner has come to this Court with this application under S.482 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 19732. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that both the Courts grossly erred in dismissing of the application and appeal under Ss. 340 and 341 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. It must have been held by the learned Magistrate and the learned Sessions Judge that it is expedient in the interest of justice to proceed against the respondent for having committed perjury. Both Courts having not done so, failure of justice has resulted and this Court may invoke the powers under S.482 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to interfere with the concurrent findings of both Courts rendered in proceedings under Ss. 340 and 341 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 19733.1 must first of all remind myself that sanction for perjury can only be the medicine of law and not its diet. Every incorrect statement or mis-statement made by a party in the course of the judicial proceedings, however, objectionable, cannot and shall not persuade the Courts to invoke the powers under S.340 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The section is very carefully worded and the nature of satisfaction to be entertained by the Court is crucial. To borrow the words of S.340 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. the Court must be \"of opinion that it is expedient in the interest of justice that an inquiry should be conducted into the offence\" allegedly committed by the alleged offender. An offence must have been committed. The Court must be satisfied that it is expedient in the interests of justice that an enquiry should be made under S.340 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973.4.1 now come to the specific facts. I find that the learned Sessions Judge adverted to this aspect. A deed of Power-of-Attorney must be properly executed before a Notary. The Notary in this case has attested the said Power-of-Attorney. What does the Notary attest? Obviously, under law, the Notary attests only the signature of the principal/ executant and the witnesses. He is the one who executes the document. Under law, Notary must attest the execution by the executant/principal. In such document at times to avoid any dispute about the signature of the attorney, the signature of the attorney is also given and the executant vouches or certifies the signature of the attorney. This cannot at all mean that the attorney is also an executant in the instrument of Power-of-Attorney as to require notarisation by the Notary of the signature of the Attorney. In the instant case, the executant is the principal. He has executed the document. That is the instrument of Power-of-Attorney. In such instrument of Power-of-Attorney, there is a signature of the attorney also. This cannot at all mean that the attorney's signature has been attested by the Notary. The whole case is built by the petitioner on the assumption that the attorney must also have signed the instrument of Power-of-Attorney along with the principal in the presence of the Notary. That assumption is certainly not justified by law.5. The learned counsel for the petitioner alertly points out that the signature of the attorney in the instrument of Power-of-Attorney also bears the date '5/1/02' which is the date on which the Notary had attested the deed of Power-of-Attorney. Relying on the identical date affixed by the Notary as also the attorney in the said Deed of Power-of-Attorney (i.e., 05/01/2002) the learned counsel contends that the attorney must also necessarily have affixed his signature in the deed of Power-of-Attorney on 05/01/2002 itself. Such execution must have been at Calcutta. Therefore, his statement that he had not gone to Calcutta is incorrect and false, contends the learned counsel for the petitioner.6.1 am unable to accept this contention. Every incorrect statement cannot be equated to a false statement. It is possible for the two situations to co-exist. Signature of the attorney is available in the deed of Power-of-Attorney. The deed was signed before the Notary by the executant/principal on 5/1/2002. The signature of the attorney could have been affixed before or after the execution of the document by the principal. Merely because the signature has been affixed by the attorney in the deed of Power-of-Attorney earlier or subsequently showing the date as '5/1/2002', it would be puerile to jump to a conclusion that the attorney must also have proceeded to Calcutta and must have been available before the Notary when the principal executed the document and the Notary attested the same.7. The statement is on a most insignificant and non-vital aspect. The cheque is issued in the name of the Attorney. Whether the liability was personal between the principal and the accused or between the attorney and the accused, as drawer the accused is liable under S. 138 of the N.I. Act. The alleged mis-statement is thus on an absolutely non-vital aspect having no crucial impact on the liability under S. 138 of the N.I. Act which was the subject matter of the proceedings.8. Yes, some doubts are aroused in the mind of the Court because of the identical date on which the signature of the attorney appears and the date of the execution by the principal and the attestation by the Notary. But I am certainly of opinion that, that cannot aggravate the statement of the respondent - attorney on oath before Court to the status of a false statement; nor can I agree that such a statement is one which in the interests of justice can be held to be expedient to initiate proceedings under S.340 oftheCr.RC.9. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that if this Court does not take any action, the right of the petitioner to complain about the impropriety/culpability is lost and he will have no other forum where such a grievance can be raised by him. That may be true. The law zealously insist that a party should not be put to any unnecessary and undeserved vexation or subjected to any vexatious proceedings for his acts in Court unless the Court authorises further proceedings against him under S.340 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. I have no hesitation to come to a conclusion that no Court can be of opinion in the given circumstances that it is expedient in the interest of justice that any further proceedings must be taken under S.340 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for the alleged indiscretion committed by the respondent - attorney in respect to the statement made on oath by him.10.1 am satisfied, in these circumstances, that this Crl.M.C. cannot succeed and deserves to be dismissed. I do so.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE K. THANKAPPAN1. Complainant in C.C.No.397/2002 on the file of the Court of the Judicial First Class Magistrate-I, Kochi is the appellant. The allegation in the complaint is as follows:-First accused, a dealer in paper and paper products, used to purchase paper products from the appellant, a public limited company, on credit for a pretty long time and as per the arrangement, the bills of the accused would be credited by the bank in favour of the appellant and amount should be paid by the accused to the bank within 90 days and in default the amount would be debited to the account of the appellant with interest. As the accused failed to pay the bill amount, the appellant had to pay the amount with interest. Thus, the accused owed a sum of Rs.40, 66, 479/-. O.S.No.686/2000 and C.C.Nos.433/2001 and 435/2001 were filed by the appellant against the accused. But during the pendency of the cases, in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties, the 2llU accused on behalf of the firm issued 4 post-dated cheques to the appellant and when one of the above cheques for Rs.50, 00, 000/- dated 30-8-2001 was presented for encashment, the same was dishonoured on the ground of insufficiency of funds in the account of the accused. On complying with the provisions regarding the notice etc., the complaint was filed. After considering the entire evidence, the Trial Court found that accused 1 and 2/respondents 1 and 2 were found guilty under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and they were convicted there under and the 1st respondent was sentenced to pay fine of Rs.5, 000/- and 2nd respondent was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for six months and to pay a compensation of Rs.5, 00, 000/- and in default to undergo six months. Accused Nos.3 and 4 were not found guilty and they were acquitted under S. 255(1) of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Aggrieved by the conviction and sentence awarded against accused 1 and 2/respondents 1 and 2, they had approached the Appellate Court by filing Crl.A.No.143 of 2005. Against the acquittal of accused 3 and 4, the appellant filed Crl.R.P.No.4/2005 before the same court. After considering the evidence, the appeal was allowed and the findings entered by the Trial Court against respondents 1 and 2 were set aside and respondents 1 and 2 were acquitted. The revision filed by the appellant was dismissed. Against the judgment of the Appellate Court, this appeal has been filed by the appellant.2. Heard the learned counsel for the appellant and the learned Public Prosecutor for the 3rd respondent State. Though notice was served on respondents 1 and 2, there is no appearance on behalf of them.3. The learned counsel for the appellant contends that the finding of the Appellate Court that the cheque was not supported by consideration is against the provisions of S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. It is also contended that the finding of the Appellate Court that the cheque was not issued in discharge of a legally enforceable debt or liability is not sustainable in law.4. It was specifically alleged in the complaint that as respondents 1 and 2 who were dealers in paper and paper products failed to pay bill amount of Rs.40, 66, 479/-, O.S.No.686/2002 was filed before the Addl. Sub Court, Emakulam and C.C.Nos.433/2001 and 435/2001 were filed before the Judl. First Class Magistrate Court-II, Ernakulam against them and in view of the settlement, the 2nd respondent on behalf of the firm issued Ext.P3 cheque and when it was presented for encashment, the same was dishonoured. Evidence adduced by the appellant would show that respondents I and 2 had failed to pay the bill amount as per the agreement and in view of the settlement, four cheques were issued by respondents 1 and 2 in favour of the appellant. If that be so, as per the provisions of S. 138 of the Act, where any cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by him with a banker for payment of any amount of money to another person from out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability, is returned by the bank unpaid, either because of the amount of money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with that bank, an offence under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is attracted. The lower Appellate Court found that in spite of receipt of cheque, the suit was proceeded against respondents 1 and 2. The pendency of a suit for recovery of a legally enforceable debt will not preclude the appellant to proceed with the matter under S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.5. The learned counsel for the appellant brought to the notice of this Court a decision of the Apex Court reported in Goa Plast (P) Ltd. v Chico Ursula D'souza (2004 (3) KLT 932004 (3) KLT 932003 ILO SC 1038 (SC) to substantiate the case of the appellant. In the above decision the Apex Court considered the same facts situation and in paragraph 26 of the above decision the Apex Court held as follows:-\"62. The object and the ingredients under the provisions, in particular, Ss. 138 and 139 of the Act cannot be ignored. Proper and smooth functioning of all business transactions, particularly, of cheques as instruments, primarily depends upon the integrity and honesty of the parties. In our country, in a large number of commercial transactions, it was noted that the cheques were issued even merely as a device not only to stall but even to defraud the creditors. The sanctity and credibility of issuance of cheques in commercial transactions was eroded to a large extent. Undoubtedly, dishonour of a cheque by the bank causes incalculable loss, injury and inconvenience to the payee and the entire credibility-of the business transactions within and outside the country suffers a serious setback. Parliament, in order to restore the credibility of cheques as a trustworthy substitute for cash payment enacted the aforesaid provisions. The remedy available in the Civil Court is a long-drawn matter and an unscrupulous drawer normally takes various pleas to defeat the genuine claim of the payee.\"It is also brought to the notice of this Court another decision of the Apex Court reported inl.C.D.S. Ltd. v. BeenaShabeer (2002(3) KLT 2182002 (3) KLT 2182002 ILO SC 1604 (SC)). In the above decision in paragraph 10, the Apex Court held as follows:-\"10. The language, however, has been rather specific as regards the intent of the legislature. The commencement of the section starts with the words \"where any cheque\". The above noted three words are of extreme significance, in particular, by reason of the use of the words \"any\" - the first three words suggest that in fact for whatever reason if a cheque is drawn on an account maintained by him with a banker in favour of another person for the discharge of any debt or other liability, the highlighted words if read with the first three words at the commencement of S.138, leave no manner of doubt that for whatever reason it may be, the liability under this provision cannot be avoided in the event the same stands returned by the banker unpaid. The legislature has been careful enough to record not only discharge in whole or in part of any debt but the same includes other liability as well.\"In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that wherever there is a default on the part of one in favour of another and in the event a cheque is issued in discharge of any debt or other liability, there cannot be any restriction or embargo in the matter of application of the provisions of S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is a penal provision. The commission of an offence under that section entails conviction and sentence on proof of the guilt in a duly conducted criminal proceeding. Once the offence is committed, the prosecution proceedings can be initiated not for recovery of the amount covered by the cheque but for bringing the offender to the penal liability. The scheme of provision contained in the new chapter would indicate that it is primarily to provide an additional criminal remedy over and above the civil remedies available under the Act.6. It has come out in evidence that respondents are dealers in paper and paper products, they used to purchase goods from the appellant as per bills and as per the agreement, bills of the accused will be credited by the bank in favour of the appellant and amount should be paid by respondents 1 and 2 to the bank and in case the accused fails to pay the amount, the amount will be debited to the account of the appellant with interest and accused failed to pay the bill amount and cases were filed by the appellant for realization of the amount from respondents 1 and 2 and the cheques were issued for settlement of the amount due from respondents 1 and 2. Respondents 1 and 2 had no case before the court that no amount was due to the appellant as per the accounts of the appellant and the cheque in question was not issued in discharge of the liability. At the same time, it can be seen that the specific case set up by the appellant is that the cheque was issued for settlement of cases. The lower Appellate Court proceeded on the wrong premise that by issuing that particular cheque a concluded contract was not arrived at and held that the cheque was not supported by consideration. Basically Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is concerned with the Law of Contracts. In contract, the term \"consideration\" means a reasonable equivalent or other valuable benefit passed on by the promisor to the promisee or by the transferor to the transferee. Further, the consideration shall be adequate or rather so as to make it sufficient and valuable having regard to the facts, circumstances and necessities of each case. The evidence adduced by the appellant would show that there exists sufficient consideration for issuing the cheque in question. If that be so, this Court is of the view that Ext.P3 cheque is issued in discharge of a legally enforceable debt or liability. Hence, the finding of the Appellate Court is perverse and is liable to be set aside.7. In the result, the impugned judgment is set aside and the appeal is allowed. Accordingly, conviction and sentence passed against respondents 1 and 2 by the Trial Court are confirmed.Appeal allowed"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE K. THANKAPPAN1. This petition for special leave to appeal is filed against the judgment in C.C. No. 1254 of 2004 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II (Mobile), Kottayam.2. The case of the petitioner - complainant was that towards discharge of an amount of Rs.42, 00, 000/- the first respondent - accused issued Ext. P1 cheque dated 6.10.2003 in favour of the petitioner which when presented to the bank for encashment was dishonoured for want of sufficient funds in the account of the accused. After complying with the statutory provisions regarding notice etc., and finding that the amount covered by Ext. P1 cheque has not been repaid, the petitioner filed the complaint against the accused alleging commission of offence punishable under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\"). To prove the case against the accused, the complainant and the Manager of the bank were examined as PWs.l and 2 respectively and Exts. P1 to P12 were produced. On the side of the defence, the accused was examined as DW 1 and Exts. D1 to D5 were produced. On closing the evidence of the complainant, the accused was questioned under S.313 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. He denied the allegations levelled against him and stated that a loan of Rs.45, 00, 000/- was obtained from the South Indian Bank by mortgaging the property of the complainant for the purpose of the partnership concern, Sindhoor Jewellery and that Ext. P1 cheque drawn on the account maintained by the partnership concern was issued as security. He further stated that the complainant and himself were the partners of the said concern. After considering the entire evidence, the Trial Court found that the petitioner - complainant failed to prove that Ext. P1 cheque was issued by the accused and that even if any liability was attached to Ext. P1, the complainant also was responsible for the same and hence, acquitted the accused.3. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that as per S. 141 of the Act, the Managing Partner or the person who is in charge of the business is responsible for the issuance of the cheque maintained by the firm and that being so, the first respondent is responsible for Ext. P1 cheque. Counsel further submits that the reply given by the first respondent would show that he was managing the affairs of the partnership firm and hence he alone is liable for the issuance of Ext. P1 cheque.4. This Court considered the arguments of the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner as well as the impugned judgment. The petitioner - complainant had admitted that he was one of the partners of the firm. It is to be noted that though all the partners including the complainant were made parties to the complaint, the firm Sindhoor Jewellery was not made a party to the complaint. Further, PW 2, the Manager of the bank had given evidence to the effect that the account was opened at the instance of the complainant and that the account belongs to Sindhoor Jewellery. There is no evidence to show that the first respondent was the nominated partner of the firm so as to make him liable for the cheque issued by the firm. Even if it is accepted, for argument's sake, chat the appellant - complainant was only a sleeping partner and hence not liable for the cheque issued from the account maintained by the firm, there is no evidence to establish that the entire assets of the firm was managed by the accused -first respondent alone. In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Court below was justified in acquitting the accused. The impugned judgment, therefore, requires no interference.The Crl. Leave Petition is accordingly dismissed.Petition dismissed"

The case stood posted for cross-examination of the complainant on 21/11/07. On that day, it is submitted, the learned counsel could not appear as the brother of the counsel had expired. The court closed the evidence and posted the case for hearing to 26/11/07. On that day, an application was filed to re-open the evidence and give the petitioner an opportunity to cross- examine the complainant. It is submitted that on that day also the complainant could not be cross-examined. The case is now posted to tomorrow - 6/12/07. It is submitted by the petitioner in the petition that the learned counsel has an unavoidable difficulty tomorrow also in connection with the obsequies to be performed in respect of the death of his brother. The petitioner has hence rushed to this Court with this petition.2.Inconvenience of the counsel will certainly be taken note of by the court and accommodation granted wherever possible. If it is the personal difficulty of the counsel, for the reasons mentioned at the Bar before me, I will refuse to believe that the learned Magistrate would not give the requisite accommodation. Any court, worth it salt, must consider the plight of the counsel and give appropriate accommodation. But certainly the counsel cannot ask for an indefinite adjournment. If he is not able to appear on the 6th, he will have to appear on the 7th and do the cross- examination. If it is inconvenient for him on the 7th also, he will have to take the court into confidence and satisfy the court that 7th is also inconvenient and it may be posted to the next date. Adjournment for a week which is the first prayer made at the Bar does not at all impress me as proper.3. I need not issue any directions as to the manner in which the learned Magistrate must consider the prayer of the petitioner's counsel on the 6th. The learned counsel must file an affidavit specifying his difficulty, if any, and must satisfy why the next day and the day after the next day are not convenient to him. He must specify the date on which he will be able to appear and take part for trial. The request must certainly be considered by the learned Magistrate on merits and with compassion.4. With the above observations, this Crl.M.C. is dismissed.5. Hand over a copy of this order to the learned counsel for the petitioner.Petition dismissed"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : K. BALAKRISHNAN NAIR1. The common question that arises for decision in these cases is whether this court can quash a complaint filed under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Coimbatore and issue a writ of prohibition against the said court from proceeding with the case, in so far as the same concerns the writ petitioner. Since the facts and the questions of law involved are the same, these cases are heard together and disposed of by this common judgment.W. P. (C) No. 21289 of 2005 :2. This writ petition is treated as the main case. The petitioner was a partner of the second respondent firm, which is an unregistered partnership firm. The first respondent is a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956, engaged in the manufacture of fertilisers and agro chemicals. The second respondent was marketing the goods manufactured by the first respondent. The petitioner retired from the partnership with effect from April 1, 2001. For the amounts due from the second respondent to the first respondent, the second respondent had issued certain cheques. Three of those cheques drawn on various dates in December 2003, when presented by the first respondent through its bank at Coimbatore, were dishonoured. So, after completing the usual formalities under the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the first respondent filed exhibit P1 complaint before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Coimbatore, alleging the offence punishable under section 138 read with section 141 of the said Act. The Magistrate after taking cognizance, issued summons to the accused, who are respondents Nos. 2 to 4 and the petitioner. The petitioner appeared before the said court and was enlarged on bail.3. The petitioner submits, the complaint against her is not maintainable. The cheques were issued in December 2003. She retired from the second respondent firm with effect from April 1, 2001. In support of that submission, the petitioner relies on exhibit P2 deed of partnership, reconstituting the partnership on April 1, 2001. The said reconstitution in the partnership was intimated to the sales tax authorities at Tripunithura, as per exhibit P3 letter. Exhibits P4 and P5 income-tax returns filed by the second respondent would show that the petitioner was a partner up to March 31, 2001, and was not a partner with effect from April 1, 2001. Exhibits P6 and P7, which relate to income-tax returns for the subsequent years, would show that the petitioner was not a partner of the firm for the subsequent years also. In view of the above position, the petitioner has been made an accused in the case unnecessarily. She cannot be said to be a person in charge and responsible for the conduct of the affairs of the firm, in the light of the decision of the apex court in Smt. Katta Sujatha v. Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore Ltd. [2002] 7 SCC 6552002 (7) SCC 6552002 ILO SC 1772 ; [2003] 114 Comp Cas 272003 (114) CC 272002 ILO SC 1772, and also the decision of the Madras High Court in Ashok Muthanna v. Wipro Finance Ltd. [2001] 105 Comp Cas 2032001 (105) CC 2032000 ILO MAD 154 ; [2001] 2 Crimes 3072001 (2) Crimes 307. On the basis of the above facts and grounds, the petitioner prays to quash exhibit P1 to the extent she is arrayed as an accused in it and also seeks of writ of prohibition to restrain the Coimbatore court from proceeding against her.4. The writ petition was admitted and stay was granted, The first respondent appeared and raised an objection that the writ petition is not maintainable. The learned single judge, who heard the matter, referred the case to be heard by a larger Bench, along with two other connected cases, by order dated August 16, 2005. The case has been referred for the apparent conflict between the Division Bench decision of this court in Krishnakumar Menon v. Neoteric Informatique P. Ltd. [2001] 3 KLT 6892001 (3) KLT 689 and another Division Bench decision in UBC v. M. R. Govarthanam [2005] 127 Comp Cas 5062005 (127) CC 506 (Ker) ; [2005] 2 KLT 4612005 (2) KLT 461. In the first decision, it was held that the power under section 482 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or under article 227 of the Constitution Of India, 1950 cannot be exercised to quash a complaint pending before a court outside Kerala. But it was observed that in appropriate cases, the jurisdiction of this court under article 226 could be invoked. Whereas, in UBC v. M. R. Govarthanam 5. Noticing the conflict between the above two decisions, the Division Bench referred the matter to be heard by a larger Bench. The relevant portion of the reference order reads as follows :\"The question in the present case is whether it could be said that any part of the cause of action has arisen within the jurisdiction of this High Court. According to the petitioner, cause of action arose in the State of Kerala and, therefore, writ petition will lie before this court. Another incidental question to be decided is when and where the cause of action or part of cause of action arise to file a complaint under section 138. Since, apparently, there are conflict of decisions of the two Division Benches, we are of opinion that the question whether a writ petition will lie before the High Court to quash a complaint pending in a subordinate court in another State, if part of the cause of action arose in this State, in deserving circumstances, should be decided by a larger Bench of this court.\"6. We heard learned counsel on both sides, Sri Joy Thattil, learned counsel for the writ petitioner mainly relied on the decision of the apex court in Navinchandra N. Majithia v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 2000 SC 29662000 AIR(SC) 29662000 ILO SC 264, in support of his submissions. Sri. S. Sreekumar, learned counsel for the first respondent mainly relied on the decision of the apex court in Mosaraf Hos-sain Khan v. Bhagheeratha Engineering Ltd. [2006] 3 SCC 6582006 (3) SCC 6582006 ILO SC 262. When learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the decision in Krishna-kumar Menon's case [2001] 3 KLT 6892001 (3) KLT 689, lays down the correct position, learned counsel for the first respondent would point out that UBC's case [2005] 127 Comp Cas 5062005 (127) CC 506 (Ker); [2005] 2 KLT 4612005 (2) KLT 461, is laying down the correct legal position. The decision in Navinchandra's case, \"15. In the aforesaid situation it is almost impossible to hold that not even a part of the cause of action has arisen at Bombay so as to deprive the High Court of Bombay of total jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition filed by the petitioner. Even the very fact that major portion of the investigation of the case under the FIR has to be conducted at Bombay itself shows that the cause of action cannot escape from the territorial limits of the Bombay High Court.\"7. The decision of this court in Krishnakumar Menon's case [2001] 3 KLT 6892001 (3) KLT 689, was under section 482 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 Various complaints were filed against the petitioner therein before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai, under the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, on the ground of dishonour of the cheques issued by him. A petition under section 482 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 was moved to quash the complaint. This court held that the said petition under section 482 is not maintainable, but observed that a petition under article 226 of the Constitution Of India, 1950 may lie, in view of the decision of the apex court in Navinchandra's case, AIR 2000 SC 29662000 AIR(SC) 29662000 ILO SC 264. Whether a petition under article 226 of the Constitution Of India, 1950 is maintainable was not a point which arose for decision in that case. De hors the said observation, the decision would stand. Therefore, the observation can only be treated as obiter dicta. The decision in UBC's case [2005] 127 Comp Cas 5062005 (127) CC 506 (Ker); [2005] 2 KLT 4612005 (2) KLT 461, was also one relating to the offences under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The appellants therein were accused in a calendar case on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Erode, in Tamil Nadu. The learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offence under section 138 of the said Act and issued summons. The appellants filed a writ petition under article 226 of the Constitution Of India, 1950, to quash the complaint, on the ground that part of the cause of action arose in Kerala and therefore, this court has jurisdiction to quash the complaint under article 226, in view of the decision of the apex court in Navinchandra's case, 8. There is a recent decision of the apex court in Mosaraf Hossain Khan v. Bhagheeratha Engg. Ltd. [2006] 3 SCC 6582006 (3) SCC 6582006 ILO SC 262, concerning quashing of a complaint. It was a case where the respondent-company had some business transactions in West Bengal. The cheque issued by the respondent in favour of the appellant bounced. The appellant moved the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Birbhum at Suri, alleging commission of the offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The Magistrate took cognizance of that offence and issued summons to the accused. Instead of appearing before the court, the respondents moved the Kerala High Court and obtained interim stay of further proceedings in the matter. The said order was challenged in appeal before the Supreme Court. The apex court allowed the appeal, holding that the Kerala High Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition, as no part of the cause of action arose in Kerala.9. In the light of the above mentioned two decisions of the apex court in Navinchandra N. Majithia v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 2000 SC 29662000 AIR(SC) 29662000 ILO SC 264 and Mosaraf Hossain Khan v. Bhagheeratha Engg. Ltd. [2006] 3 SCC 6582006 (3) SCC 6582006 ILO SC 262, which Division Bench decision of this court, that is whether the decision in Krishnakumar Menon's case [2001] 3 KLT 6892001 (3) KLT 689, or the decision in UBC's case [2005] 127 Comp Cas 5062005 (127) CC 506 (Ker); [2005] 2 KLT 4612005 (2) KLT 461, lays down the correct legal position, is the point to be answered in this case. There cannot be any dispute that the complaint before the Coimbatore court and taking cognizance of the same by the said court cannot be challenged under section 482 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or under article 227 of the Constitution Of India, 1950, before this court. The only contention raised is that a writ petition under article 226 will lie, in view of clause (2) thereof, as part of the cause of action in the transaction regarding issuance of the cheque, its dishonour etc., arose in Kerala.10. Article 226(2) reads as follows :\"226. Power of High Courts to issue certain writs.-. . . (2) The power conferred by clause (1) to issue directions, orders or writs to any Government authority or person may also be exercised by any High Court exercising jurisdiction in relation to the territories within which the cause of action, wholly or in part arises for the exercise of such power, notwithstanding that the seat of such Government or authority or the residence of such person is not within those territories.\"11. The said clause was introduced as clause (1A) by the 15th Amendment Act, 1963, in view of the decisions of the apex court in Election Commission, India v. Saka Venkata Subba Rao [1953] SCR 11441953 SCR 1144, K. S. Rashid and Son v. Income-Tax Investigation Commission [1954] 25 ITR 1671954 (25) ITR 1671954 ILO SC 20 (SC) ; [1954] SCR 7381954 SCR 738, Lt. Col. Khajoor Singh v. Union of India, AIR 1961 SC 5321961 AIR(SC) 5321960 ILO SC 449 and Collector of Customs v. East India Commercial Co. Ltd., AIR 1963 SC 11241963 AIR(SC) 11241962 ILO SC 514. The result of the above decisions was that writ petitions under article 226 against the Union of India were maintainable only in the High Court of Punjab, as at the relevant time the territory of national capital was under the jurisdiction of the said High Court. The High Courts of Madras and Assam took a different view that if part of the cause of action arose within the respective States, writs could be issued to the Union of India by them. To get over the above decisions of the apex court and make the law in tune with the decisions of the above High Courts, the amendment was introduced. Article 226 was drastically amended by Constitution (Forty-Second Amendment) Act, 1976. The original position was substantially restored later, by the Constitution 44th Amendment Act, 1978. In view of clause (2) of article 226, if part of the cause of action arose in the State, writ could be issued against an authority, though the seat of it is outside the territorial jurisdiction of this court.12. But, the cause of action which must arise in Kerala for issuing the writs of certiorari or prohibition, must relate to the commissions or omissions of an inferior court or tribunal amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this court and not that of a private party. This court cannot judicially review the actions of the first respondent. It may file any complaint before any court. It may do it rightly or wrongly. The first respondent being a private party not amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this court, we cannot judicially review its actions. But, the point to be decided is whether we can judicially review the action of the Magistrate in taking cognizance under section 190(1)(a) read with section 200 of the Cr. P. C, of the offence alleged against the petitioner and issuing process under section 204. The entire cause of action, as far as the action of the learned Magistrate is concerned, arose in Coimbatore, outside the jurisdiction of this court. So, even if the complainant has wrongly filed a complaint before the Coimbatore court, the action of taking cognizance and issuance of the process took place outside the jurisdiction of this court. Therefore, we have no doubt in our mind that the reliefs sought in this writ petition cannot be granted by this court. We are of the view that the decision of the Division Bench in UBC v. M. R. Govarthanam [2005] 127 Comp Cas 5062005 (127) CC 506 (Ker); [2005] 2 KLT 4612005 (2) KLT 461, lays down the correct legal position. The observation in Krishnakumar Menon's case [2001] 3 KLT 6892001 (3) KLT 689, concerning the power of this court under article 226 of the Constitution Of India, 1950 is an obiter. Further, the decision of the apex court in Navinchandra's case, AIR 2000 SC 29662000 AIR(SC) 29662000 ILO SC 264, cannot have any application to a case arising on a private complaint under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. In Navinchandra's case, 13. The reference is answered as above. Since nothing more survives to be decided in this case, it is unnecessary to send this case back to the Division Bench or the single Bench. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed without prejudice to the contentions of the petitioner regarding the merits of her case and her right to move the Coimbatore court, where the complaint is pending, or the Madras High Court, for appropriate reliefs.W. P. (C) Nos. 21240 and 21241 of 2005 :14. The judgment in W. P. (C) No. 21289 of 2005 will govern these cases also, as the facts and the question raised are identical. Accordingly, they are also dismissed without prejudice to the contentions of the petitioner regarding the merits of her case and her right to move the appropriate court for appropriate reliefs.Order accordingly"

In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in S.T. No. 2053 of 2004 on the file of the J.F.C.M-II, Attingal challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice.Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence in the light of the recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court that no default sentence can be imposed for an order for compensation under Section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 The sentence imposed on the revision petitioner is set aside and instead he is sentenced to pay fine of Rs.1, 52, 000/-(Rupees one lakh and fifty two thousand only) which shall be deposited within six months from today and on default to make the payment, he shall suffer simple imprisonment for three months. The fine amount shall be paid as compensation under Section 357(1) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

Cognizance was taken and the case stood posted for appearance to 18.9.2007. On that day the petitioner appeared through counsel and the case was posted to the next date. On that date of posting the petitioner was laid up and could not appear. Thereupon a warrant of arrest has been issued against the petitioner rejecting the application to excuse his absence. The case now stands posted to 7.12.2007.2. According to the petitioner he is absolutely innocent. His absence was not wilful. He is willing to surrender before the learned Magistrate and seek bail. But he apprehends that his application for bail may not be considered by the learned Magistrate on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. In these circumstances it is prayed that appropriate directions may be issued to the learned Magistrate to release the petitioner on bail on the date of surrender itself.3.It is certainly for the petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate and explain to the learned Magistrate the circumstances under which he could not earlier appear before the learned Magistrate. I have no reason to assume that the learned Magistrate would not consider the application for bail to be filed by the petitioner when he surrenders before the learned Magistrate, on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously. Every court must do the same. No special or specific direction appears to be necessary. Sufficient general directions have already been issued by this Court in the decision in Alice George v. Dy.S.P. of Police (2003 (1) KLT 339)2003 (1) KLT 339.4. This application is accordingly dismissed. I may however hasten to observe that if the petitioner appears before the learned Magistrate and applies for bail after giving sufficient prior notice to the Prosecutor in charge of the case, the learned Magistrate must proceed to pass orders on merits, in accordance with law and expeditiously - on the date of surrender itself. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, there shall be a direction that the warrant of arrest issued against the petitioner shall not be executed till 7.12.2007, on or before that date the petitioner shall appear before the learned Magistrate and seek regular bail.Application dismissed"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE K. THANKAPPAN1. This appeal is filed against the judgment in C.C. No. 1329 of 1998 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Karunagappally. The complainant in the above Calendar Case is the appellant.2. The case of the complainant was that the accused - respondent herein borrowed from him an amount of Rs. 1, 00, 000/- and issued Ext.P1 cheque towards discharge of the above liability which when presented to the bank for encashment was dishonoured for want of sufficient funds in the account of the accused. Since the amount covered by the cheque was not repaid inspite of issuance of notice prescribed under the statute, the appellant filed the complaint. To prove the case against the accused -respondent, the complainant himself was examined as PW.1 and the Manager of the Bank was examined as PW.2 and Exts.P1 to P6 were produced. On the side of the defence, DWs.1 and 2 were examined and Exts.D1 to D3 were produced. After closing the evidence of the complainant, the accused was questioned under S.313 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. He denied the allegations levelled against him. After considering the entire evidence, the Trial Court acquitted the accused on the ground that the complainant failed to file the complaint within one month from the date of acceptance of the notice by the accused.To come to this conclusion, the Trial Court relied on Ext.D1 notice which showed that the cheque in question was already dishonoured and hence the second notice issued against the accused - respondent was not within the purview of S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\").3. Heard the learned counsel appearing on either side and perused the records made available before this Court.4. The contention of the learned counsel appearing for the appellant is that the evidence of PW.2, the Manager of the Bank and Ext.P6 register maintained by the bank would show that the cheque in question was presented only once, and that was on 18.4.1998. If so, the cause of action for the appellant to file the complaint arises only after 18.4.1998, on getting information from the bank regarding the dishonour of the cheque.5. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent relying on the decision of the Apex Court reported in Sadanandan Bhadran v. Madhavan Sunil Kumar (1998 (2) KLT 7651998 (2) KLT 7651998 ILO SC 1179 (SC)) and the decision of this Court reported in Lakshmanan v. Sivarama Krishnan (1995 (1) KLT 259)1995 (1) KLT 259 contends that as per Ext.D1 notice, the cause of action for the appellant to file the complaint against the respondent arises on 23.2.1998 as Ext.D1 notice is dated 23.2.1998.6. The short question to be decided in this appeal is whether the cause of action for the appellant to file the complaint against the respondent arises on 23.2.1998, or on 27.4.1998, the date on which Ext.P3 notice was issued.7. Clause (b) of the proviso to S.138 of the Act reads as follows:\"(b) the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as the case may be, makes a demand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice in writing, to the drawer of the cheque, within fifteen days of the receipt of information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid.\"A reading of the above clause would show that a payee or the holder in due course of a cheque shall make a demand for the payment of the amount covered by the cheque by issuing a notice in writing to the drawer of the cheque within 15 days of receipt of information from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid. In this context, learned counsel appearing for the appellant relies on the decision of the Apex Court reported in Uniplas India Ltd. v. Government of NCT of Delhi (2001 (3) KLT 452001 (3) KLT 452001 ILO SC 310 (SC)) and submits that even if a notice has been issued earlier, the cause of action would arise only after getting information from the bank.8. The cheque in question was dated 15.2.1998. As per the evidence of PW.2 and Ext.P6 document, it is proved that Ext.P1 cheque was presented to the bank for collection only on 18.4.1998. Ext.P6 register maintained by the bank for receipt and return of cheque would show that the cheque in question was presented only once. That being so, the cause of action for the appellant to send notice or to file the complaint would arise only after receipt of information regarding dishonour of the cheque. The bank should give the information, based on the account maintained in the name of the drawer of the cheque, as to whether the cheque was returned unpaid by the bank either because the amount of money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with the bank. This is clear from the wordings of S.138 of the Act. Dishonour of the cheque or non-payment of the amount covered by a cheque shall be informed by the bank to the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque and that information shall be based on the account standing in the name of the drawer. In other words the information should not be an oral one collected by the complainant. In the light of the above reasoning, this Court is of the view that the judgment of the Trial Court is not legally sustainable. Accordingly, the impugned judgment is set aside and the matter is remanded to the Trial Court for fresh disposal. The parties are allowed to adduce additional evidence, if any.The Crl. Appeal is allowed by way of remand. The parties shall appear before the Trial Court on 6.10.2007.Appeal allowed"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE V. RAMKUMAR1. The petitioner herein is the revision petitioner/accused in a prosecution under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The request of the petitioner in this petition is to get the disputed signature in Ext.P10 compared with the admitted signatures of the petitioner by a handwriting expert of the Forensic Science Laboratory, Thiruvananthapuram.2. The case of the first respondent/complainant who is a money lender is that the accused borrowed a sum of Rs. 4.25 lakhs as evidenced by Ext.P10 voucher dated 9-4-1999 and towards discharge of the said liability the accused issued Ext.P4 cheque dated 14-3-2002 for Rs. 6, 10, 000/- and on presentation of the cheque in the drawee bank, it bounced.3. The revision petitioner inter alia took up the stand that in relation to certain previous transactions with the complainant bank, five blank cheques were taken by the complainant from the revision petitioner and Ext.P4 cheque is one of those cheques and the signatures in Ext.P10 voucher as well as Ext.P4 cheque were forged.4. The revision petitioner has a grievance that, one Advocate Mohan was engaged by him to appear for him in the Trial Court and the said Advocate expired during the pendency of the case and since a junior advocate was thereafter appearing for the petitioner, he did not take prompt steps for getting the disputed signature examined by an expert.5. The learned counsel appearing for the first respondent/complainant opposed the application contending inter alia as follows:-The revision petitioner/accused had not cared to send even a reply to the statutory notice sent by him. No such petition was filed by him before the Trial Court. Notwithstanding slight discrepancy, the signatures in Ext.P4 cheque and ExtP10 voucher resemble the undisputed signatures of the accused in his vakalath, deposition (DW1) etc. The Trial Court has noticed that his own admitted signature in Ext.P9 postal acknowledgment differs from his own other admitted signatures. He did not dispute his signature in Ext.P4 cheque and, therefore, the question of comparing the signatures by a handwriting expert does not arise.6. I am afraid that I cannot agree with the above submissions on behalf of the complainant. The accused has offered an explanation as to why no reply was given by him to the statutory notice. According to him, after receipt of the said notice, when he approached the complainant, the complainant assured him that he need not take the notice seriously and accordingly took the notice from the accused who was thus disabled from preparing a reply to the notice. He has similar explanation as to why no such petition was filed before the Trial Court. The counsel whom he had engaged to conduct the case passed away and it was a relatively inexperienced junior who conducted the case.7. It cannot be said that the signatures in Exts.P4 cheque and P10 voucher resemble the admitted signatures of the accused. I have attempted a comparison of the signature found in Ext.P4 cheque and Ext.P10 voucher with the undisputed signatures of the accused in his deposition as D:W.1. There appears no similarity at all in the signatures in Exts. P4 and P10 with admitted signatures of the accused in his deposition. In fact, in paragraph 10 of the judgment of the Trial Court it is observed that there is some dissimilarity in the signature in Ext.P10 voucher with the signature of the accused in Ext.P4 cheque and with the signatures of the accused in the bail bond, vakalath and deposition etc. No doubt, the admitted signature of the accused in Ext.P9 postal acknowledgment card does not bear any similarity with his admitted signatures in the vakalath, bail bond and deposition. No two signatures of the same person can ever be identical in all respects. But the essential and unique characteristics of the writings of a person will invariably be present even if those signatures were to be replicated by the same person. The discrepancies in such a case will be within the natural variations. When the Court itself entertained some doubt after observing the discrepancies iq the signatures, the Court should not have ventured to form an opinion merely because S.73 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 enables the Court to compare the signatures. Even though, there is no bar for the Court to compare the admitted signatures/writings with the disputed signatures/writings and come to its own conclusion, it would be more prudent to require the opinion of an expert. (See O.Bharathan v. K. Sudhakaran & Anr. (1996 (1) KLT 4661996 (1) KLT 466 (SC) = AIR 1996 SC 1140)1996 AIR(SC) 11401996 ILO SC 3311 and State (Delhi Administration) v. Pali Ram (AIR 1979 SC 14)1979 AIR(SC) 141978 ILO SC 90. As a matter of extreme caution and judicial sobriety the Court should not normally take upon itself the task of comparing the disputed signature with the admitted signature or handwriting and in the event of the slightest doubt, the Court should leave the matter to the wisdom of an expert. (Ajit Savant Majagvai v. State of Karnataka, (1997) 7 SCC 110)1997 (7) SCC 1101997 ILO SC 574.8. After comparing the signatures in Exts. P4 cheque and P10 voucher with the admitted signatures of the accused in his deposition as D.W.I and other admitted signatures, I entertain serious doubt as to the genuineness of the signatures on Ext.P4 cheque and Ext.P10 voucher and also the writing of the name of the accused in Ext. PlO. It will be unsafe, if not hazardous for the Court to attempt a comparison unaided by the scientific opinion of an expert. I am therefore of the view that without getting an expert opinion regarding the above, this Court should not venture to decide the matter on the merits. I do not consider it necessary to set aside the impugned judgments and remit the entire case to the Trial Court. It will be sufficient to call for a finding from the Trial Court. Eventhough this is a revision, it is well settled that the revisional jurisdiction is another facet of the appellate jurisdiction. (Vide Shankar Ramachandra Abhyankar v. Krishnaji Dattaraya Bapat (1987 (2) KLT 848)1987 (2) KLT 848, Thambi v. Mathew (AIR 1970 SC 1)1970 AIR(SC) 11969 ILO SC 533, State of Kerala v. Ussain (1990 (1) KLT 498)1990 (1) KLT 498. If so, this Court can invoke the power under S.391 (1) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 read with Ss. 397 and 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and direct the trial Magistrate to send the disputed signature in Ext.P4 cheque and the disputed writing of the name of the accused and the disputed signature in Ext.P10 voucher to the handwriting expert in the Forensic Science Laboratory, Thiruvananthapuram for comparison with the admitted writings and signatures of the accused. The records in this case shall, accordingly be forwarded to the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Pathanamthitta who shall send the disputed signature in Ext.P4 cheque and the disputed writings including the signature in Ext. P10 voucher to the handwriting expert in the Forensic Science Laboratory, Thiruvananthapuram for comparison with the admitted writings and signatures of the accused. After receipt of the report from the expert, the Chief Judicial Magistrate shall record his findings in that behalf and forward the finding to this Court within four months of receipt of a copy of this order.Parties shall appear before the trial Magistrate on 8-8-2007 without any further notice. The lower Court records shall be forwarded to the Trial Court forthwith.Post the above Crl. R.P. on 12-12-2007.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE K. THANKAPPANComplainant in C.C.No.529/98 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-I, Ernakulam is the appellant. First respondent, accused in the complaint was acquitted on the ground that no notice was served on the 1st respondent and the appellant could not prove that the 1st respondent have knowledge of the notice or he had refused to receive the same. The Case of the appellant is that the 1st respondent purchased spare parts worth for Rs.23, 989/- and issued Ext.P1 cheque for that amount and when it was presented for encashment, the same was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds in the account of the 1 st respondent. On receipt of intimation of dishonor of the cheque, a lawyer's notice was caused to the 1st respondent demanding of the amount covered by the cheque. The said notice was returned to the appellant with the endorsement \"not claimed\". Thereafter, the complaint was filed. To prove the case against the 1st respondent, the appellant himself was examined as PW1 and Exts.Pl to P6 were marked. After closing the evidence of the appellant, the 1st respondent was questioned under S.313 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 He denied the allegation and stated that he was having no transaction with the appellant and Ext.P1 cheque was given as a security to Meenakshi Enterprises, After considering the entire evidence, the trial court acquitted the 1st respondent on the ground that the complaint was filed without giving a statutory notice to the 1st respondent as provided under proviso (b) to S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\".2. The learned counsel for the appellant submits that the finding entered by the trial court with regard to the service of notice is perverse. The learned counsel further submits that the trial court ought to have found that the appellant had proved the issuance of notice and there was a deliberate evasion on the part of the 1st respondent in receiving the notice.3. It is not disputed that the cheque was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds in the account of the 1st respondent. Ext.P3 memo snows that the cheque was returned to the appellant on 10-9-1996. Ext.P5 postal receipt shows that the appellant had sent demand notice to the 1st respondent on 19-9-1996. The notice was returned with the endorsement \"not claimed\". When the 1st respondent was questioned under S.313 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 his case was that he had issued Ext.Pl cheque to Meenakshi Enterprises as security. This was only bald defence as no attempt was made to prove his case. The trial court did not consider it as a ground for acquittal. However, the trial court after considering the facts and circumstances of the case found that the complaint was filed without giving a statutory notice to the 1st respondent as provided under S.138 of the Act and hence the complaint was not maintainable. To come to the above conclusion, the trial court had relied on two decisions of this Court reported in Sosamma v. Rajendran (1993 (1) KLT 629)1993 (1) KLT 6291993 ILO KER 223 and Hameed Bafaky v. Moideen (1995 (2) KLT 619)1995 (2) KLT 619.4. Question to be considered in this case is whether a notice returned with the endorsement \"not claimed\" or \"unclaimed\" can be considered as sufficient for the purpose of due compliance with S.138 of the Act?Proviso (b) to S.138 of the Act reads as follows:-\"the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as the case may be, makes a demand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice in writing, to the drawer of the cheque, within thirty days of the receipt of information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid\".5. In Madhu v. Omega Pipes Ltd (1994 (1) KLT 441)1994 (1) KLT 4411994 ILO KER 209 His Lordship Justice K.T. Thomas, as he then was, interpreted the expression \"giving a notice in writing\" used in proviso (b) to S.138 of the Act and held that \"the realistic interpretation for the expression \"giving notice\" in the present context is that if the payee has despatched notice in the correct address of the drawer reasonably ahead of the expiry of thirteen days, it can be regarded that he make the demand by giving notice within the statutory period\".To come to this conclusion His Lordship relied on a decision of the Apex Court reported in Narasimhah v. Singri Gowda (AIR 1966 SC 330)1966 AIR(SC) 3301964 ILO SC 88. In the above decision the Apex Court considered the provision and held as follows:-\"Giving\" of anything as ordinarily understood in the English language is not complete unless it has reached the hands of the person to whom it has to be given. In the eye of law however \"giving\" is complete in many matters where it has been offered to a person but not accepted by him. Tendering of a notice is in law therefore giving of a notice even though the person to whom it is tendered refuses to accept it. We can find however no authority or principle for the proposition that as soon as the person with a legal duty to give the notice despatches the notice to the address of the person to whom it has to be given , the giving is complete.\"Though the trial court had relied on the above decision, the principle adopted by the Apex Court was not correctly applied in the facts and circumstances of the present case. In a decision reported in Rajneesh Aggarwal v. Amit J. Bhalla ((2001) 1 SCC 631)2001 (1) SCC 6312001 ILO SC 20417 the Apex Court considered the question of \"issuing notice\" and held that \"the object of issuing notice indicating the factum of dishonour of the cheque is to give an opportunity to the drawer to make the payment within 15 days, so that it will not be necessary for the payee to proceed against in any criminal action, even though the bank dishonoured the cheques\". This question was also considered by this Court in a decision reported in Joseph Jose v. Baby (2002 (3) KLT SN 64)2002 (3) KLT 64 and this Court categorically held that \"sending of notice in the correct address of the accused and return of the same with endorsement \"unclaimed\" are sufficient for the purpose of due compliance with S.138(b) of the N.I. Act\". The burden of the appellant to prove that the notice was given to the 1st respondent was discharged, as it has come out in evidence that the postal authorities have given intimation of the notice to the 1st respondent to whom it has to be given. If so, it is the duty of the 1st respondent to show that the notice was not in the correct address or not served on him.6. In the above circumstances, this Court has no hesitation to come to a conclusion that the trial court has committed an error in recording a finding that the complaint was filed without giving a statutory notice to the 1st respondent as provided under proviso (b) to S.138 of the Act. Hence, the impugned judgment is set aside and the matter is remanded to the trial court for fresh consideration. Both the appellant and the 1st respondent shall be given an opportunity to adduce additional evidence, if any, to substantiate their case. As the matter is of the year 1996, it shall be disposed of as early as possible, at any rate within three months from the date of appearance of the parties.The parties shall appear before the court below on 21-7-2007.Order accordingly"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE R. BASANTShould the notice of demand under proviso (b) to S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 be issued such that the drawer shall receive the notice within the period of 30 days? Is it sufficient if such notice is put into post within the said period of 30 days? How is the expression \"by giving a notice in writing..............within thirty days of the receipt of information\" in proviso (b) to S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 to be understood? Does the observation in Madhu v. Omega Pipes Ltd., (1994 (1) KLT 441)1994 (1) KLT 4411994 ILO KER 209 that such notice must be dispatched \"reasonably ahead of the expiry of fifteen days\" oblige the complainant to dispatch such notice in such time as to ensure receipt within 30 days? These are the interesting questions that arise for consideration in this case.2. Fundamental facts are not in dispute. The cheque dated 29/4/05 for Rs.80, 000/-was dishonoured on 3/5/05 and intimation was given of such dishonour on the same day. Notice of demand dated 1/6/05 was issued on 1/6/05. It was put into post on 1/6/05 and was received by the drawer on 4/6/05. If it is sufficient that dispatch of the notice is made within 30 days, the notice is sufficient and proper. On the contrary, if despatch of the notice must be so made as to ensure receipt within 30 days, we will further have to consider the question whether a notice dispatched on 1/6/05 would have ordinarily reached the complainant on or before 2/6/05.3. Provisos (b) and (c) to S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 are relevant. I extract the said clauses:\"138. Dishonour of cheques for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account.-xxx xxx xxxProvided that nothing contained in this section shall apply unless-(a) xxx xxx xxx(b) the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as the case may be, makes a demand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice, in writing, to the drawer of the cheque, within thirty days of the receipt of information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid; and(c) the drawer of such cheque fails to make the payment of the said amount of money to the payee or, as the case may be, to the holder in due course of the cheque, within fifteen days of the receipt of the said notice. (emphasis supplied)4. A question was raised whether receipt of the notice must be insisted within the period (15 days as per the law at the relevant time) in Madhu v. Omega Pipes Ltd., (1994 (1) KLT 441)1994 (1) KLT 4411994 ILO KER 209. His Lordship Mr. Justice K.T.Thomas clearly held that the expression \"give notice\" is not synonymous with \"receipt\" of the notice and in these circumstances, it would be sufficient if despatch of the notice is made within the stipulated period and the receipt by the drawer is after the said period. But His Lordship in para-6 of the said decision posed the following question and finally answered the same in para-7 in the following words:\"6................Is it enough that he sends it just two or three days before the end of the said period since the postal authority would take the notice to the address with reasonable despatch and promptitude?7..............Hence the realistic interpretation for the expression \"giving notice\" in the present context is that if the payee has dispatched notice in the correct address of the drawer reasonably ahead of the expiry of fifteen days, it can be regarded that he made the demand by giving notice within the statutory period.\"5. The learned counsel for the petitioner contends that to fall within the dictum in Madhu v. Omega Pipes Ltd., (1994(1) KLT 441)1994 (1) KLT 4411994 ILO KER 209 the complainant must have issued (put in post) the notice well prior to 3/5/05 to ensure its receipt before 3/5/05. The contention hence is that it is not enough if the notice is sent within 30 days; but it must be sent within 30 days to ensure receipt within such period of 30 days.6. The expression \"give\" must admit many shades of meanings. In former days the expression \"giving\" could have been treated as synonymous with the expression \"taking\" or \"receipt\". \"Giving\" is the process of which \"receipt\" is the culmination. In a one to one personal transaction of giving and taking both acts fuse in the same conduct, \"giving\" being the commencement of the process and \"receipt/taking\" the simultaneous final point of that transaction. But life presents myriad situations where there can be a gap of time between the act of giving such a notice and the act of receiving/taking. Yes, the expression \"giving\" may include the acting of taking also at the end of it in a normal case; but there may be many situations where an inevitable gap of time and space may be there between the two acts. Law cannot be unequal to life. Interpretation must meet the challenge of law - to conform to the practical realities of life. The interpreter cannot be a mere die hard linguist. He must harmonie the inherent limitation of semantics to the practical realities of life as also the challenges before law. In doing so legislative goals, dreams and vision must be imbibed by the interpreter. He must resonate to the frequency of the legislature.7. While proviso (b) to S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 speaks of giving the notice, proviso (c) refers to the act of receipt. The different acts contemplated under the provisos (b) and (c) have to be performed within the time specified in those provisos. Inevitably and unmistakably we find that the law did contemplate notice in writing to be issued by post. S.94 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 speaks of the modes in which notice has to be given and notice by post is a perfectly legal method by which notice can be given. I extract S.94 of the N.I. Act below:\"94. Mode in which notice may be given.- Notice of dishonour may be given to a duly authorized agent of the person to whom it is required to be given, or, where he has died, to his legal representative, or, where he has been declared an insolvent, to his assignee; may be oral or written; may, if written, be sent by post; and may be in any form; but it must inform the party to whom it is given, either in express terms or by reasonable intendment that the instrument has been dishonoured, and in what way, and that he will be held liable thereon; and it must be given within a reasonable time after dishonour, at the place of business or (in case such party has no place of business) at the residence of the party for whom it is intendedIf the notice is duly directed and sent by post and miscarries, such miscarriage does not render the notice invalid.\"The legislature when it enacted, S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 was evidently conscious of S.94 which permitted and did mandate the giving of notice by post. In a case where notice is not given directly and is given through the agency of post/ courier etc., the legislature was aware 6f the inevitability of the gap of time between the act of giving and the act of receiving. This has realistically been taken note of in provisos (b) and (c) when different points of time were fixed for giving of notice and to comply with the demand in such notices after receipt of that notice. The conclusion appears to be inevitable, in these circumstances, that to constitute the act of giving in S.138(b) it is enough if notice in writing is put into post before the expiry of 30 days. Even if it were done immediately prior to mid night on the 30th day, that would be sufficient compliance of the mandate of S.138(b) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, So far as the period of limitation for payment under proviso (c) is concerned, it is the date of receipt of the said notice which is crucial and vital. His Lordship Mr. Justice K.T. Thomas was not concerned in Madhu v. Omega Pipes Ltd., (1994 (1) KLT 441)1994 (1) KLT 4411994 ILO KER 209 with the situation which we have on hand at present. The question raised in para-6 and the answer given in para-7 do eminently convey this fact. In holding that the notice has to be despatched \"reasonably ahead of the period\", his Lordship evidently had only intended that the rubicon at the end of the period fixed (i.e., 15 days then) shall not be crossed. It would therefore be, according to me, unreasonable and myopic to spell out a dictum from the said observations that it is not enough if notice is put into post within the period of 30 days and it must be put into post in such time so that receipt within 30 days can be ensured. That would be against the dictum in Madhu v. Omega Pipes Ltd., 8. I do, in these circumstances, come to the conclusion that notice need be given within 30 days under proviso (b) to S.138 and if notice is despatched before the expiry of 30 days by post/courier or other means, that would be sufficient compliance of proviso (b) to S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.9. That being the answer to the question of law raised, the petitioner does not have any ground to get the prosecution against him quashed by invoking the extraordinary inherent jurisdiction under S.482 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 197310. In the result, this Writ Petition fails and is dismissed.Petition dismissed"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE V. RAMKUMAR1. In this Revision filed under Section 397 read with Sec. 401 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the petitioner who was the accused in S.T. No.538 of 2004 on the file of the J.F.C.M-II, Palakkad challenges the conviction entered and the sentence passed against him for an offence punishable under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').2. I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice. Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below. The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence in the light of the recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court that no default sentence can be imposed for an order for compensation under Section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 The sentence imposed on the revision petitioner is set aside and instead he is sentenced to pay fine of Rs.20, 000/-(Rupees twenty thousand only) which shall be deposited within three months from today and on default to make the payment, he shall suffer simple imprisonment for three months. The fine amount shall be paid as compensation under Section 357(1) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"

        "text": "The Judgment was delivered by : HON'BLE JUSTICE R. BASANT1. The petitioners are accused 1 and 2 in a prosecution under Sec.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The 1st petitioner/accused No.1 is a partnership firm and the 2nd petitioner/accused No.2 is its Managing Partner. The proceedings under Sec.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 was initiated on the basis of a complaint filed by the complainant/2nd respondent herein.2. The trial court found the petitioners guilty. The Sessions Court, in appeal, set aside the conviction. This Court in the appeal against acquittal restored the verdict of guilty, conviction and sentence passed by the trial court. The 1st petitioner has been sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.5, 000/- and the 2nd petitioner has been sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months. He has also been directed to pay an amount of Rs.5 lakhs as compensation. Default sentence has also been prescribed.3. The petitioners have now come before this Court to apprise this Court of the subsequent settlement and composition of the offence. The 2nd respondent has entered appearance through counsel. He confirms that the disputes have been settled and that the 2nd respondent/complainant has compounded the offence alleged against the petitioners. The entire amount due to the 2nd respondent has already been received, it is submitted.4. An application has been filed by the rival contestants duly countersigned by their respective counsel to confirm that there has been some settlement/composition.5. The appellate judgment rendered by this Court restoring the verdict of guilty, conviction and sentence has now become final. The learned counsel, in these circumstances, prays that the dictum in Sabu George v. Home Secretary (2007 (1) KLT 982)2007 (1) KLT 9822007 ILO KER 30 may be invoked and the 2nd petitioner may be saved of the trauma of incarceration in prison notwithstanding the composition.6. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am satisfied that this is an eminently fit case where the dictum in Sabu George v. Home Secretary (2007 (1) KLT 982)2007 (1) KLT 9822007 ILO KER 30 can be invoked in favour of the 2nd petitioner to save him from the trauma of incarceration in prison notwithstanding the composition. I am further satisfied that the direction for payment of compensation need not be enforced, the 2nd respondent having admitted that the entire amount has been paid and received in full satisfaction of his claim. I am not satisfied that the sentence imposed against the 1st petitioner/ accused No.1 deserves to be interfered with notwithstanding the composition. I am satisfied that the sentence imposed against the 2nd petitioner/accused No.2 alone need be set aside invoking the powers under Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C. as explained in the dictum in Sabu George v. Home Secretary 7. This Crl.M.C. is accordingly allowed in part. The sentence imposed on the 2nd petitioner under Sec.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 including the direction for payment of compensation and the default sentence is hereby quashed.8. Hand over a copy of this order to the learned counsel for the petitioner.Order accordingly"

The cheque in question involves a sum of Rs.2, 50, 000/-. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner submitted that it was consistent with the existing practice in the court of Judicial First Class Magistrate-I, Punalur that the revision petitioner/complainant produced a stamped cover bearing postal stamps for Rs.25/- for issuing warrant to the accused.Whatever may be the usual practice, there is no justification for producing stamped cover for issuing warrant. The requisite process fee has to be deposited by the revision petitioner/complainant for the purpose of issuing warrant to the absconding accused. That has not been done. At the same time I am not inclined to hold that the revision petitioner is grossly negligent in the conduct of his case. He had produced a stamped postal cover consistent with the practice that was followed in that court. A wrong practice cannot make good law. Hence, the revision petitioner has to deposit the process fee in this behalf. The impugned order is accordingly set aside and C.C. No. 785/2006 is restored to file. The revision petitioner shall appear before the court below without any further notice on 10.12.2007. By that time he would have deposited the necessary process fee for issuing warrant against the accused in the case.The Crl.R.P. is disposed of as above.Petition disposed of"

I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.3. The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner re-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision. The courts below have concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the petitioner in favour of the complainant on the drawee bank, that the cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured for reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the complainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in accordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act and that the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment within 15 days of receipt of the statutory notice.Both the courts have considered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner while entering the above finding. The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence. I do not find any error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below.The conviction was thus rightly entered against the petitioner.4. What now survives for consideration is the question as to whether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision Petitioner. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am, however,inclined to modify the sentence in the light of the recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court that no default sentence can be imposed for an order for compensation under Section 357(3) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973The sentence imposed on the revision petitioner is set aside and instead he is sentenced to pay fine of Rs.70, 000/-(Rupees seventy thousand only) which shall be deposited within four months from today and on default to make the payment, he shall suffer simple imprisonment for three months. The fine amount shall be paid as compensation under Section 357(1) Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but modifying the sentence as above.Petition disposed of"
