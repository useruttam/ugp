On 19.03.2014, eleven criminal complaints were filed in the\n\ncourt of the Metropolitan Magistrate, each seeking prosecution of the\n\nparties shown in the array of respondents for offences punishable\n\nunder Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, two of\n\nsuch complaints i.e. the complaint nos.800/1/14 and 802/1/14 having\n\nbeen        presented             by      Jwala         Devi         Enterprises              Pvt.

Pooja Enterprises.  Each of the said\n\ncriminal complaints were directed against several persons including a\n\ncompany described as M/s. Bush Foods Overseas Pvt. Ltd.  It may be\n\nmentioned that Mr. Virkaran Awasty was reflected in the array of the\n\naccused as the Managing Director of the said company accused.  The\n\nrespondents in these petitions were amongst the other persons shown\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.                                                                                         Page 10 of 24\n\n\n\n\nas accused in the said complaints, each of them having been described\n\nas “Director” of the said company accused.\n\n2.          On       the      basis        of     the      preliminary               inquiry          in     each        case,       the\n\nMetropolitan                  Magistrate               issued           process             including              against           the\n\nrespondents herein.  The respondents, feeling aggrieved, approached\n\nthe court of Sessions invoking its revisional jurisdiction by separate\n\npetitions (CR nos.34-62/2015),  their prime contention being that there\n\nwas no case made out for they to be summoned as accused on the\n\nbasis of allegations that they were directors of the company accused,\n\ndenying that they had any concern with the responsibility for the\n\nconduct of the day-to-day business of the company.\n\n3.          Placing reliance primarily on decision of a bench of three\n\nHon’ble Judges of the Supreme Court in SMS Pharmaceuticals Pvt.\n\nLtd. Vs. Neeta Bhalla, (2005) 8 SCC 89, the court of Sessions found\n\nsubstance and merit in the aforesaid contentions and allowed all the\n\nabove-said revision petitions by a common order dated 18.04.2015\n\nholding that the summoning order had been passed by the Magistrate\n\nmechanically without going through the material(s) on record, there\n\nbeing no averment to the effect that the said persons were in charge of,\n\nor responsible for the conduct of the business of, the company accused\n\nand consequently dropping the criminal proceedings against each of\n\nthem.\n\n4.          The petitions at hand have been filed by the complainants\n\ninvoking the inherent jurisdiction of this court under Section 482 of\n\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr. PC) and Article 227 of the\n\nConstitution of India, 1950 to pray for the aforesaid orders of the\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.                                                                                         Page 11 of 24\n\n\n\n\nSessions court in each of the said eleven complaint cases to be set\n\naside and the proceedings against the respondents herein to be revived\n\non the file of the Metropolitan Magistrate.  Reliance is placed in this\n\ncontext by the petitioners on the decisions of benches of two Hon’ble\n\nJudges of the Supreme Court reported as Gunmala Sales (P) Ltd. Vs.\n\nAnu Mehta and Ors, (2015) 1 SCC 103 and Standard Chartered Bank\n\nVs. State of Maharashtra and Ors., (2016) 6 SCC 62.  There can be no\n\nquarrel with the proposition, as advanced by the counsel for the\n\nrespondents, that the ruling of the bench of three Hon’ble Judges in\n\nSMS         Pharmaceuticals                      (supra),           continues             to      hold        the       field,       the\n\ndecisions in Gunmala Sales (P) Ltd. (supra) and Standard Chartered\n\nBank (supra) having accepted this position and the said subsequent\n\nrulings being in a slightly different context.\n\n5.          These matters pertain to the penal clause contained in Section\n\n138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, which reads thus :-\n\n              138. Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds\n              in the account — Where any cheque drawn by a person\n              on an account                     maintained               by     him       with        a    banker for\n              payment of any amount of money to another person from\n              out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in part,\n              of any debt or other liability, is returned by the bank\n              unpaid, either because of the amount of money standing to\n              the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the\n              cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid\n              from that account by an agreement made with that bank,\n              such        person           shall       be      deemed            to     have         committed              an\n              offence           and         shall,        without            prejudice              to      any        other\n              provision of this Act, be punished with imprisonment for 8\n              [a term which may be extended to two years’], or with\n              fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque,\n              or with both:\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.                                                                                         Page 12 of 24\n\n\n\n\n         Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply\n         unless—\n\n          (a) the cheque has been presented to the bank within a\n         period of six months from the date on which it is drawn or\n         within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier;\n\n         (b) the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as\n         the case may be, makes a demand for the payment of the\n         said amount of money by giving a notice; in writing, to the\n         drawer of the cheque,  within thirty days of the receipt of\n         information by him from the bank regarding the return of\n         the cheque as unpaid; and\n\n         (c) the drawer of such cheque fails to make the payment of\n         the said amount of money to the payee or, as the case may\n         be, to the holder in due course of the cheque, within\n         fifteen days of the receipt of the said notice.\n\n         Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, “debt of\n         other liability” means a legally enforceable debt or other\n         liability.\n\n6.      It is clear from the plain reading of the above quoted provision\n\nand is now also well settled that the offence under Section 138 of the\n\nNegotiable Instruments Act does not stand constituted merely upon\n\ndishonor of a cheque.  The dishonor of a cheque which had been\n\nissued by the person (who is sought to be prosecuted) in favour of the\n\ncomplainant must be followed by a notice of demand within the\n\nstipulated period.  It is the non-payment of the amount of the cheque\n\nwithin the statutory period after service of the notice of demand which\n\nconstitutes the offence that is punishable under the aforementioned\n\nprovision of law.\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.

It is the above quoted provision, which is at the bottom of the\n\ncontroversy in the present matters and in this context the rulings of the\n\nSupreme Court referred to above provide the necessary guidance.\n\n9.      Certain observations in SMS Pharmaceuticals (supra) which\n\nhave been quoted in the subsequent decisions, need to be borne in\n\nmind and, therefore, may be extracted as under :-\n\n                 “10. … What is required is that the persons who are\n                 sought to be made criminally liable under Section 141\n                 should be, at the time the offence was committed, in\n                 charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct\n                 of the business of the company. Every person connected\n                 with the company shall not fall within the ambit of the\n                 provision. It is only those persons who were in charge of\n                 and    responsible      for   the   conduct      of   business     of   the\n                 company at the time of commission of an offence, who\n                 will be liable for criminal action. It follows from this that\n                 if a Director of a company who was not in charge of and\n                 was not responsible for the conduct of the business of the\n                 company at the relevant time, will not be liable under the\n                 provision. The liability arises from being in charge of\n                 and    responsible      for   the   conduct      of   business     of   the\n                 company      at   the   relevant     time   when     the   offence     was\n                 committed and not on the basis of merely holding a\n                 designation or office in a company. Conversely, a person\n                 not holding any office or designation in a company may\n                 be liable if he satisfies the main requirement of being in\n                 charge of and responsible for the conduct of business of a\n                 company at the relevant time. Liability depends on the\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.                                                   Page 15 of 24\n\n\n\n\n                 role one plays in the affairs of a company and not on\n                 designation or status. If being a Director or Manager or\n                 Secretary was enough to cast criminal liability, the\n                 section would have said so. Instead of “every person” the\n                 section would have said “every Director, Manager or\n                 Secretary in a company is liable”, etc. The legislature is\n                 aware that it is a case of criminal liability which means\n                 serious consequences so far as the person sought to be\n                 made liable is concerned.  Therefore, only persons who\n                 can be said to be connected with the commission of a\n                 crime at the relevant time have been subjected to action.\n\n                                 x x x\n\n        “19. In view of the above discussion, our answers to the\n        questions posed in the reference are as under:\n\n         (a) It is necessary to specifically aver in a complaint under\n        Section 141 that at the time the offence was committed, the\n        person accused was in charge of, and responsible for the\n        conduct of business of the company. This averment is an\n        essential requirement of Section 141 and has to be made in\n        a complaint. Without this averment being made in a\n        complaint, the requirements of Section 141 cannot be said\n        to be satisfied.\n\n         (b) The answer to the question posed in sub-para (b) has to\n        be in the negative. Merely being a director of a company is\n        not sufficient to make the person liable under Section 141 of\n        the Act. A director in a company cannot be deemed to be in\n        charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of\n        its business. The requirement of Section 141 is that the\n        person sought to be made liable should be in charge of and\n        responsible for the conduct of the business of the company\n        at the relevant time. This has to be averred as a fact as\n        there is no deemed liability of a director in such cases.\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.                                                   Page 16 of 24\n\n\n\n\n         (c) The answer to Question (c) has to be in the affirmative.\n        The question notes that the managing director or joint\n        managing director would be admittedly in charge of the\n        company and responsible to the company for the conduct of\n        its business. When that is so, holders of such positions in a\n        company become liable under Section 141 of the Act. By\n        virtue of the office they hold as managing director or joint\n        managing director, these persons are in charge of and\n        responsible for the conduct of business of the company.\n        Therefore, they get covered under Section 141. So far as the\n        signatory of a cheque which is dishonoured is concerned,\n        he is clearly responsible for the incriminating act and will\n        be covered under sub-Section (2) of Section 141.\n\n                                                           (emphasis supplied)\n\n10.     In Gunmala Sales (P) Ltd. (supra), the issue brought before the\n\nSupreme Court by the complainant primarily was that the High Court\n\nin exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr. PC had wrongly\n\nquashed the proceedings against the respondents on the ground that\n\nthere was a bald assertion in the complaint that they were directors in\n\nthe company at the time when the offence was committed.  While\n\nacknowledging (in para 27) that the decision in SMS Pharmaceuticals\n\n(supra) still holds the field, in Gunmala Sales (P) Ltd. (supra), it was\n\nfurther clarified thus :\n\n          “27. It is clear from a perusal of the above decisions that\n          SMS Pharma (1) [S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v.

For cases where the allegations in the complaint in writing are\n\nnot deficient but the persons are described as directors  (who seek\n\nquashing of the summoning order), it was ruled in Gunmala Sales (P)\n\nLtd. (supra) as under :-\n\n          “31. When in view of the basic averment process is issued\n          the complaint must proceed against the Directors. But, if\n          any Director wants the process to be quashed by filing a\n          petition under Section 482 of the Code on the ground that\n          only a bald averment is made in the complaint and that he\n          is really not concerned with the issuance of the cheque, he\n          must in order to persuade the High Court to quash the\n          process      either    furnish    some      sterling    incontrovertible\n          material or acceptable circumstances to substantiate his\n          contention. He must make out a case that making him\n          stand the trial would be an abuse of process of court. He\n          cannot get the complaint quashed merely on the ground\n          that apart from the basic averment no particulars are\n          given in the complaint about his role, because ordinarily\n          the basic averment would be sufficient to send him to trial\n          and it could be argued that his further role could be\n          brought out in the trial.

(supra)          were\n\nsummarized thus :-\n\n              “35.         …       Pertinently,               in     the       application               filed        by      the\n              respondents,                no      clear        case        was        made         out       that       at    the\n              material time, the Directors were not in charge of and were\n              not      responsible               for     the      conduct            of    the      business            of     the\n              Company by referring to or producing any incontrovertible\n              or unimpeachable evidence which is beyond suspicion or\n              doubt or any totally acceptable circumstances.

Similar is the case\n              with Kanhaiya Lal Mehta and Anu Mehta.

(supra)          was\n\nendorsed and reiterated in Standard Chartered Bank (supra).\n\n14.         The guiding principles with reference to Section 141 of the\n\nNegotiable Instruments Act, 1881, which are now well settled by\n\njudicial pronouncements, some of which have been noted above, may\n\nbe summarised thus :-\n\n         (i)             It is only those persons who are in charge of or\n\n         responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at\n\n         the time of commission of the offence under Section 138 of\n\n         the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 who can be subjected to\n\n         criminal action with reference to Section 141;\n\n\n\n         (ii).           If the person committing an offence under Section\n\n         138  of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is a company,\n\n         the       person          who         was        signatory            to      the      cheque           which          is\n\n         dishonoured is clearly responsible for the incriminating act\n\n         and would be liable to be proceeded against under Section\n\n         141 (2);\n\n         (iii).          By virtue of the office they hold, the persons working\n\n         in the capacity of the Managing Director or Joint Managing\n\n         Director are deemed to be in charge of, and responsible for\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.

Merely because a person is a director of the company\n\n          is not  sufficient to make him liable under Section 141, there\n\n          being no deeming that by holding such position he is in\n\n          charge of, or responsible for the conduct of the business of,\n\n          the company within the meaning of Section 141;\n\n          (v).            It is necessary for the complainant to specifically aver\n\n          in the complaint that at the time the offence was committed,\n\n          the person sought to be prosecuted was in charge of, or\n\n          responsible for the conduct of the business of, the company in\n\n          terms          of      Section           141,         there         being          no      need         for       further\n\n          particulars to be given in the complaint about his role, this\n\n          being subject to proof at the trial;\n\n          (vi).           The person who has been summoned as an accused\n\n          for offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments\n\n          Act, 1881 on the basis of averment that he was director of the\n\n          company accused, he being in charge of or responsible for the\n\n          conduct of its business cannot get the complaint quashed by\n\n          the High Court by filing a petition under Section 482 of the\n\n          Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 merely on the ground that\n\n          no      particulars              as      to     his       role       have         been         set      out       in      the\n\n          complaint; and\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.                                                                                              Page 21 of 24\n\n\n\n\n         (vii).          The person who has been summoned as an accused\n\n         for offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments\n\n         Act, 1881 by invoking the provision contained in Section 141\n\n         may persuade the High Court to quash the process in exercise\n\n         of its inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of\n\n         Criminal              Procedure,              1973          by      furnishing              “some           sterling\n\n         incontrovertible                     material             or       acceptable               circumstances”\n\n         substantiating his contention that he was not in charge of nor\n\n         responsible for the conduct of the business of the company\n\n         “at the time the offence was committed” and thereby showing\n\n         a case that making him stand the trial would be an abuse of\n\n         the process of court, but not otherwise.\n\n15.         A perusal of the eleven complaints from which the present\n\nproceedings arise reveals that they are founded on identical averments\n\n(some          of     the      accused            who        are      not       before          this      court        being         not\n\ncommon), the exception being with regard to the particulars of the\n\ncheques or the background facts against which they had been issued or\n\nthe dates on which they were presented or dishonored leading to\n\ndemand notices in their respect being issued, there being no payment\n\nmade pursuant to such demand notices.  The averments crucial to pass\n\nthe muster of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881,\n\nhowever,             are      identically             worded            in     the      said       eleven          cases.            For\n\nillustration, the crucial averments appearing in one of such complaints\n\n(Crl.

It is further submitted that at the\n          time of issuance of the said cheques, the accused persons\n          have     assured,       promised        and     represented         to    the\n          Complainant that the said cheques would be honored on\n          presentation.  However, the said Cheques, which are the\n          subject matter of the present complaint, were dishonored\n          on presentment.  The accused persons have no intention to\n          make the said payment to the Complainant.

It is clear from the bare perusal of the above quoted averments\n\nthat they are deficient to the effect that there is not even a whisper of\n\nallegation that the respondents are persons who were in charge of or\n\nresponsible to the company accused for the conduct of its business “at\n\nthe time the offence was committed”.\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.

They cannot be roped in merely because they have been\n\ndirectors of the company accused.
