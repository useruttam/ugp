However, what was whole\n\n                        liability; how and when did it arise and what were the\n\n                        relations between the complainant and accused, had not\n\n                        been disclosed in the complaint.\n\n              (ii)       As per the complaint, the complainant had given a\n\n                         friendly loan to the accused.  However in his cross-\n\n                         examination, the complainant came with a different\n\n                         version and stated that he had approached the accused for\n\n                         becoming an agent in the business of installation of\n\n                         mobile towers, which had been run by the accused.  Even\n\n                         if the said version of the complainant is presumed to be\n\n                         correct, it has nowhere disclosed as to how in the course\n\n                         of that business, a legal liability had arisen to be\n\n                         discharged by the accused in favour of the complainant.\n\n              (iii)      Moreover, the complainant could not be able to prove the\n\n                         fact that the accused had been doing any business of\n\n                         installation of mobile towers. There was no proof with\n\n                         the complainant to prove the fact that he had worked\n\n                         with the accused in the course of said business.                                                                                 -3-\nCRM-A-384-MA-2017\n\n             (iv)       The complainant himself admitted that there had been\n\n                        cuttings in the column of date and on the body of cheque\n\n                        in question.  The entire writing on the cheque had been\n\n                        overwritten and the date on the cheque had also appeared\n\n                        to have been changed by way of overwriting.\n\n                The learned Magistrate has taken a reasonable and probable\n\nview on appreciation of evidence.\n\n                As per the conclusion drawn by the learned Magistrate, the\n\ncomplainant has miserably failed to prove as to how the liability had been\n\narisen to be discharged by the accused towards him. The date and body of\n\nthe cheque had been altered by way of overwriting and such overwriting\n\nexisted over the whole body of the cheque.  The said alteration of date had\n\nnot been signed by the accused on the cheque, therefore, the accused could\n\nnot be held liable for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the\n\nNegotiable Instruments Act.\n\n                Thus, in view of the totality of the circumstances and the settled\n\nposition of law, the case attempted to be built by the complainant, appears\n\nto be suffering from fatal infirmities so much so it goes directly to the root\n\nof the case and shakes the very edifice on which the case of complainant\n\nrests.  It is also relevant to mention here that the criminal conviction entails\n\nenigmatic and stigmatic exposures and experiences and thus it become of\n\nparamount importance to demand evidence of unimpeachable character and\n\nof unambiguous nature.\n\n                Therefore, considering the above mentioned facts and legal\n\npositions, it would not be unjustified and completely misplaced to say that                                                                                 -4-\nCRM-A-384-MA-2017\n\nthe complainant has miserably failed to prove that the impugned cheque had\n\nbeen issued against the discharge of any enforceable debt or liability.\n\nPreponderance of probabilities lies completely in favour of the accused.\n\nFurther, the case of complainant is required to rest on his own leg and the\n\nsame cannot be allowed to be bypassed in a casual and cosmetic manner.\n\n                Learned counsel for the applicant, although, made sincere\n\nattempt, yet failed to draw the attention of this Court to any substantive\n\nerror or perversity. Still further, the reasons which have been extracted\n\nabove, appear to be probable and plausible.\n\n                From the above, I do not find any ground to grant special leave\n\nto file appeal. Therefore, finding no merit in the present application, the\n\nsame is dismissed.\n\n11.02.2020                                              (HARNARESH SINGH GILL)\nparveen kumar                                                            JUDGE\n\nNote:           Whether speaking/reasoned                       :        Yes/No\n                Whether reportable                              :       Yes/No\n"

No.449/2000 on the\nfile of the J.F.C.M.-I, Thiruvananthapuram challenges  the conviction\nentered and the sentence passed against  him for an offence punishable\nunder  Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter\nreferred to as 'the Act').\n        2.      I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and\nthe learned Public Prosecutor.\n        3.      The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner\nre-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision.  The courts below\nhave concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the\nrevision petitioner in favour of the  complainant on the drawee bank, that\nthe cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured\nfor reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the\ncomplainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in\naccordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act  and\nthat the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment  within\n15 days of receipt of the statutory notice.                       Both the courts have\nconsidered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner\nwhile  entering the above finding.   The said finding has been recordedCrl.R.P.No.3184/07\n                                              : 2 :\n\non an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence.  I do  not find\nany error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently\nby the courts below.  The conviction was thus rightly entered against\nthe  petitioner.\n        4.      What now survives for consideration is the question as to\nwhether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision\nPetitioner.  I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on\nthe revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition\nhereinafter mentioned.  Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the\n1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357\n(3) Cr.P.C. a sum of Rs.1,35,000/- (Rupees one lakh and thirty five\nthousand only) within four months from today, then he need to undergo\nonly imprisonment till the rising of the court.  If on the other hand, the\nrevision petitioner commits default in making the payment as aforesaid,\nhe shall undergo simple imprisonment for three months by way of\ndefault sentence.  Money, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant\nto the orders, if any, passed by the lower appellate court shall be\nrefunded to the revision petitioner.\n        This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but\nmodifying the sentence as above.\n\n                                                             (V.

The trial court found the petitioner guilty of the\n\n   offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable\n\n   Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act')\n\n   and convicted him thereunder and sentenced him to\n\n   undergo simple imprisonment  for a period of three months\n\n   and also directed him to pay an amount of Rs.76,081/- as\n\n   compensation to the complainant and in default of payment\n\n   of compensation, to undergo simple imprisonment for a\n\n   period of two months.\n\n              3.         The            petitioner                  filed           Crl.Appeal.No.456/2013\n\n   challenging the conviction entered and the sentence\n\n   imposed on him by the trial court. The appellate court\n\n   confirmed the conviction as well as sentence and dismissed\n\n   the appeal. The concurrent findings of guilty, conviction\n\n   and sentence made against him by the courts below areCrl.Rev.Pet.No.1317 OF 2019    3\n   challenged in this revision petition filed by the petitioner.\n\n              4.         Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and also\n\n   the first respondent.\n\n              5.         The complainant is a partnership firm conducting\n\n   a jewellery. The case of the complainant was that the\n\n   accused                   had             purchased                       gold             ornaments                       worth\n\n   Rs.3,46,081/-                      from           the         jewellery                 on        05.12.2007                    and\n\n   06.12.2007 on credit basis and that he paid a total amount\n\n   of Rs.2,70,000/- only                                   and that the balance amount of\n\n   Rs.76,081/- was due from him. It was alleged by the\n\n   complainant that the accused executed and issued a\n\n   cheque for the balance amount of Rs.76,081/- to the\n\n   complainant.\n\n              6.         During the trial of the case, PW1 and PW2 were\n\n   examined on the side of the complainant and Exhibits P1 to\n\n   P7 documents were marked. No evidence was adduced by\n\n   the accused.\n\n              7.          PW1 is the managing partner of the complainant\n\n   firm. He gave evidence regarding the transaction and alsoCrl.Rev.Pet.No.1317 OF 2019    4\n   the issuing of the cheque by the accused towards the\n\n   balance amount due to the firm in the transaction. A staff\n\n   of the jewellery was examined as PW2.  He also gave\n\n   evidence regarding the transaction and execution of Ext.P1\n\n   cheque by the accused and delivery of it by him to the\n\n   complainant.\n\n              8.         The plea of the accused was that he had repaid\n\n   the         entire            amount                due         to       the         complainant                     but         the\n\n   complainant did not return the cheque to him which was\n\n   given as a security. No evidence was adduced by the\n\n   accused to prove the aforesaid plea. No evidence was\n\n   adduced by him to prove the payment of the entire amount\n\n   due to the complainant. In such circumstances, I find no\n\n   illegality or impropriety in the appreciation of the evidence\n\n   by the courts below and the findings entered by them.\n\n   Conviction of the petitioner for the offence under Section\n\n   138 of the Act is only to be confirmed.\n\n              9.         The trial court has sentenced the petitioner to\n\n   undergo simple imprisonment for a period of three months\n\n   for the offence under Section 138 of the Act. An offenceCrl.Rev.Pet.No.1317 OF 2019    5\n   committed under Section 138 of the Act is almost in the\n\n   nature of a civil wrong which has been given criminal\n\n   overtones. Considering this fact and considering the\n\n   amount involved,  I find that this is not a case in which\n\n   substantive sentence of imprisonment has to be awarded\n\n   on the accused. The sentence imposed on the petitioner by\n\n   the courts below requires interference by this Court.\n\n           10.     In the result, the revision petition is allowed in\n\n   part. Conviction of the petitioner/accused for the offence\n\n   under Section 138 of the Act is confirmed. The sentence of\n\n   simple imprisonment for a period of three months imposed\n\n   on the petitioner by the courts below is set aside. The\n\n   petitioner/accused is sentenced to imprisonment till the\n\n   rising of the court. The direction made by the trial court\n\n   that the petitioner shall pay an amount of Rs.76,081/- as\n\n   compensation to the complainant and the default sentence\n\n   imposed on the petitioner are confirmed.\n\n           11.     It is submitted that the petitioner/accused has\n\n   already paid Rs.70,000/- to the complainant towards\n\n   compensation. Whatever be the amount paid, it is for theCrl.Rev.Pet.No.1317 OF 2019    6\n   petitioner/accused to produce proper receipt before the\n\n   trial court to prove payment of compensation to the\n\n   complainant. The petitioner is granted a period of one\n\n   month  from                          today            to        pay           the          entire             amount                of\n\n   compensation.                             It         would                 be            sufficient                   if         the\n\n   petitioner/accused                             pays           the         amount                of       compensation\n\n   directly to the complainant and  produces proper receipt\n\n   regarding such payment in the trial court instead of\n\n   depositing                       the             amount                    in           that              court.                The\n\n   petitioner/accused shall appear before the trial court\n\n   within a period of one month to receive the sentence of\n\n   imprisonment till the rising of the court.\n\n                                                                         Sd/-\n\n                                                                          R.

Petitioners are accused in the calendar case, which was registered on the strength of a private complaint, lodged by the respondent, under Section 138 of The Negotiable Instruments Act, as regards dishonour of a cheque.\n\n\t\t3. While the court fee payable for the complaint was Rs.325/-, at the time of presenting the complaint on 29.09.2003, the complainant paid  Rs.100/- only, thereby the complaint was returned by the Judicial Magistrate on 10.10.2003, mentioning, \"sufficient stamps to be affixed\".  \n\n\t\t4. After complying with the said direction, the complaint was re-presented on 16.10.2003 and, on 20.10.2003, the said complaint was again returned with an endorsement that in the petition, name of the accused, who issued the cheque on behalf of the firm, i.e., fourth accused was not clearly mentioned.  When it was re-presented on 23.10.2003 on fourth occasion, the complaint was again subjected to return by the Court on 14.11.2003, stating that the previous return was not complied with properly and, hence, the same was further re-presented on 19.11.2003.  Thereafter, on 09.02.2004, after scrutiny of the complaint and recording the sworn statement of the complainant, the learned Judicial Magistrate found a prima facie case and  took cognizance of the matter.\n\n\t\t5. The main contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners  is that after receipt of a complaint by a criminal Court, return of the same to the complainant is alien to criminal law and, hence, the complaint has to suffer dismissal in limine, in view of the defects found therein.  It is his further contention that the moment the court seal is affixed on the complaint, the complaint becomes the property of the Court and it is strange to return back the same, which act of the Court would vitiate the proceedings and that the law expects a defect free complaint to be made to a Judicial Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence and, as a corollary, the Magistrate should have dismissed the complaint under Section 203 Cr.P.C.  Also, it is his argument that repeated returns of complaint by the Judicial Magistrate is out of the framework of The Negotiable Instruments Act and, by means of return, the legal point of limitation for lodging the complaint is miserably thwarted.\n\t\t6. One more point canvassed on behalf of the petitioners is that there is no provision either in Cr.P.C. or Criminal Rules of Practice, for return of  complaint, for the purpose of affixing proper court fee, after it was presented with deficit court fee and, as such, the complaint should have suffered dismissal at the hands of the Magistrate, for insufficient court fee.\n\n\t\t7. Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent would submit that law recognises return of complaint by a Judicial Magistrate, for making good of certain defects, and, returning of complaint, which was presented to the Court in time, and its representation afterwards could, in no way, be construed as extension of statutory period of limitation and the order of returning the complaint was only administrative, which was not at all judicial, so as to prejudice the rights of the other side, which have accrued to him by law of limitation.\n\n\t\t8. In order to justify the order of return passed by the Judicial Magistrate, learned counsel for the respondent seeks aid of Section 207 Cr.P.C., which provides that when the Magistrate is not competent to take cognizance of the matter, he may return it for presentation before the proper Court.  By saying so, the learned counsel submits that the return of complaint cannot be said to be unknown to criminal law.  In so far as affixing of inadequate court fee is concerned, he relied upon the provisions of  Sections 4 and 5 of the Tamil Nadu Court Fee and Suit Valuation Act,1955, which empower the Presiding Officer of a Court to extend the time for affixing proper court fee payable on the plaint or petition, as the case may be.  In support, he also relies upon the analogous provisions of Order 7, Rule 11 C.P.C., stating that the plaint shall be rejected only where the relief claimed is properly valued but the plaint is written upon paper insufficiently stamped, and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to supply the requisite stamp-paper within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so.  He further adds that the Court has got every right to require a party to supply additional requisite stamp paper to rectify the defect, which is a mere procedural aspect and not an illegality.\n\n\t\t9. With regard to the events of returning and re-presenting the complaint by the Court and the complainant respectively, we have to see, whether they would prejudice the valuable legal rights of the accused.   If the answer is positive, the proceedings in C.C.No.104 of 2004 will have to face quashment.\n\t\t\n\t\t10. It is well settled that an irregularity can at any time be rectified, but the answer will be emphatically NO, in case of illegality and if it occurs in a proceeding, it has to be axed out.\n\n\t\t11. Learned counsel for the petitioners cites a Division Bench decision of this Court in A.Vinayagam and three others v. Dr.Subash Chandran and another, 2000 (I) CTC 225,  in which it was held that it is the duty of the complainant to produce defectless complaint, which becomes the property of the Court, after Court seal is affixed on it and the Court fee stamps have been cancelled.  It was further held therein that endorsement of returns would not be termed to be judicial orders and they could, at the most, be termed to be administrative orders and only after examining the complainant or witnesses, the order passed by the Magistrate would be a judicial one, in the absence of which, the Judicial Magistrate has no jurisdiction to pass any orders. In the said decision, two previous judgments of this Court in T.Vanamalai v. T.D.Sundara Varadhan, 1995 (2) L.W.(Crl.) 405 and D.Ramamoorthy v. K.J.Duraisamy, 1995 (1) L.W.(Crl.) 300, were referred to and finally on the basis of the dictum laid down by the Apex Court, it was concluded that the date of initial presentation of the complaint has to be taken for the purpose of calculating the limitation and, hence, it should be deemed to have been validly filed and, on that ground, the accused cannot claim any benefit.  The relevant portion of the said Division Bench judgment in Vinayagam's case reads as follows :\n\n\t22.... It is the cardinal principle of law that the act of court should not prejudice any one \u0016 \"Actus curise neminem Gravabit\". The Supreme Court has reiterated this principle in Jang Singh v. Brijlal and others, AIR 1966 SC 1631 : 1964 (2) S.C.R.145.  There, the Supreme Court had refused to find fault with a party, who had made short payment by one rupee, for which the court was responsible.  We would choose the same course by holding that once the complaints were filed within limitation, merely because the Magistrates, completely contrary to the procedure known to law, chose to return the same without fixing the date for re-presentation, it should not be held that the subsequent filing by the complainants would be held to be beyond limitation.\"\n\n\t\t12. Following the principle laid down in the decision aforementioned, it is to be held that though there was deficit court fee on the date of original presentation of the complaint within the prescribed period of limitation, it could be said to be valid, irrespective of the subsequent returns by the Court.  The return of plaint for rectification of certain defects as to  court fee and re-presentation by the party after rectification to the Court are the stages in administrative procedures.  Since the complainant or any of the witnesses were not examined, the return by the Court was not at all a judicial order, so as to prejudice the accused.   The accused has no say in the matter of payment of deficit court fee by the complainant before taking cognizance of the complaint by the Judicial Magistrate, since it is a matter between the Court and the complainant.  When the complaint is presented within the statutory period, the accused has no right to focus his attention to the proceedings and contend that the inadequately stamped complaint would cause prejudice to him.  In case the complaint got time barred, it could be observed that the valuable statutory right, which would accrue to the accused, would get endangered.  In the absence of such circumstance before taking cognizance, the acts of the Court, which are purely administrative in nature, could not be questioned or challenged by the accused persons.  Though the return of complaint by the Judicial Magistrate is an irregular procedure, it could not be termed to affect the rights of the accused, as, such irregularity could always be rectified. I hasten to add, that, in this case, it is not an irregularity.\n\n\t\t13. It transpires that the accused had already knocked the doors of this Court by filing Criminal O.P.No.28835 of 2004 for quashment of the  very same C.C.No.104 of 2004 on certain other grounds, but the said petition was dismissed on 24.01.2005. \n\n\t\t14. It is contended by the learned counsel for the respondent that the grounds, which are portrayed by the petitioners in the present petition, were already available at the time of filing the previous petition and, after a lapse of about one year, the petitioners have come forward with this petition.\n\t\t15. On 24.06.2005, the trial has commenced. The complainant filed proof affidavit for chief-examination and produced 36 exhibits.  After a lapse of over one year i.e., on 02.11.2006, the present petition has been presented before this court, for quashing the proceedings.    \n\n\t\t16. In this context, learned counsel for the respondent would strenuously argue that after the trial was opened for examination of witnesses, there would be no quashment of the proceedings and, hence, the case has to see its quietus.  He placed reliance upon a decision of this Court in P.Sumathi v. M.P.Ashok, 2002 (4) CTC 323, in which, a decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court was referred and followed.  The relevant portion of the said judgment, which contains the incorporation of the relevant portion of the Supreme Court judgment, is as follows :\n\n\t\"7. In support of this, I would rely upon the decision reported in Amar Chand Agarwala v. Shanthi Bose, AIR 1973 SC 799, wherein it has been observed as follows :\n\n\t\"Where the accused moved the High Court at the time when the trial was almost coming to a close and what remained to be done was the examination of two prosecution and one court witnesses and the High Court quashed the charge and entire proceedings on the grounds that the complainant suppressed material facts and that the evidence on record did not establish the alleged offence.  The order was liable to be set aside.  The proper course at that stage to be adopted by the High Court was to allow the proceedings to go on to come to its logical conclusion, one way or the other and decline to interfere with those proceedings.  The questions whether there was suppression and whether the evidence established the alleged offence were matters to be considered by the trial court after an appraisal of the entire evidence.\" \n\n\t\t17. Guided by the principles set out in the above said decision of the Apex Court, this Court has to allow the trial Court to proceed with the trial and dispose of the matter. In other words, the case before the trial Court, which is in part-heard stage, can, in no way, be quashed and if any order of quashment is passed, it would be classically improper.  Hence, it is not proper for this Court, to exercise the power, conferred under Section 482 Cr.P.C. In the light of the illuminating judicial pronouncements and in view of the circumstances available in this case, no valid ground is made out to interfere with or disturb the proceedings in C.C.No.104 of 2004 on the file of Judicial Magistrate, Sathiamanagalam, and the said case has to come to its logical conclusion.\n\n\t\t18. Therefore, this petition is devoid of merits and dismissed.  Consequently, the connected Criminal M.P.No.1 of 2006 is also dismissed.\n\nIndex : Yes\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   05-10-2007\nInternet : Yes\ndixit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tS.PALANIVELU,J.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCRL.O.P.No.27778 OF 2006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t05-10-2007\n\n"

In the case of Shanku Concretes Pvt Limited Vs. State of\nGujarat (supra), this Court has held and observed in para-10 as\nunder:-\n\n          10. Pursuing Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments\n          Act, the part of the section, which is relevant for this\n          matter is \" for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any\n          debt or other liability\" the preexisting condition is,\n          there must be the existence of any debt or any other\n          liability, for which the cheque might have been issued\n          and bounced. Reverting back to the facts of the case, it\n          is an admitted case that the company i.e. the original\n          accused No.2 wanted to promote its production and,\n          therefore, borrowed Rs. 15 lacs from the original\n          complainant i.e. the present respondent No.2. The\n          Managing Director, at present absconding, original\n          accused No.2 on behalf of the company original\n          accused No.1, entered into an agreement, clearly\n          binding himself and the company, to repay the amount\n          within six months from the date of the execution of the\n          agreement. It clearly appears that to ensure the due\n          performance of the terms further accused No.2 issued\n          seven cheques of due dates to the complainant and\n          necessary           averments            were       also       made        in     the\n          agreement that for the due performance of the\n\n                                               Page  7 of  12         R/CR.MA/20851/2017                                                                                                 JUDGMENT\n\n          agreement i.e. repayment of the advances afterthe six\n          months from the date of the agreement cheques are\n          delivered. Some of the such cheques were bounced,\n          for which the complaint is filed.\n\n8.       In the case of             Indus Airways Pvt. Ltd and others Vs.\nMagnum Aviation Pvt. Ltd (supra), the Apex Court has held and\nobserved in paras-12 and 13 as under:-\n\n          12. The interpretation of the expression \u2018for discharge\n          of any debt or other liability\u2019 occurring in Section 138\n          of the N.I.,Act is significant and decisive of the matter.\n\n          13.     The       explanation           appended           to     Section        138\n          explains the meaning of the expression \u2018debt or other\n          liability\u2019      for     the      purpose         of    Section        138.       This\n          expression means a legally enforceable debt or other\n          liability. Section 138 treats dishonoured cheque as an\n          offence, if the cheque has been issued in discharge of\n          any debt or other liability. The explanation leaves no\n          manner of doubt that to attract an offence under\n          Section 138, there should be legally enforceable debt\n          or other liability subsisting on the date of drawal of the\n          cheque. In other words, drawal of the cheque in\n          discharge of existing or past adjudicated liability is sine\n          qua non for bringing an offence under Section 138. If a\n          cheque is issued as an advance payment for purchase\n          of the goods and for any reason purchase order is not\n          carried to its logical conclusion either because of its\n          cancellation or otherwise, and material or goods for\n          which purchase other was placed is not supplied, in our\n          considered view, the cheque cannot be held to have\n          been drawn for an exiting debt or liability. The\n          payment by cheque in the nature of advance payment\n          indicates that at the time of drawal of cheque, there\n          was no existing liability.\n\n9.       In the case of Taramanidevi Purushottamdasji Mahota\nVs. State of Gujarat (supra), this Court has held and observed in\npara-20 as under:-\n\n          20.     Once it is conceded that facts and circumstance\n          of the case dominates and play decisive role, then it\n          would not be difficult to accept the myth of might of\n\n                                               Page  8 of  12         R/CR.MA/20851/2017                                                                                                 JUDGMENT\n\n          presumption under section 139 of the Act. At least in\n          two ways, presumption becomes vulnerable to an\n          attack by other side. One, fact may makes way for the\n          accused and special facts or peculiar fact of the case\n          may held back the operation of presumption or in\n          peculiar facts of the case, the Court may look into the\n          material brought on record by the accused in support\n          of his say that cheque is not issued in discharge of any\n          debt or liability. In order to prevent injustice, the Court\n          may look into such material. In short, submission about\n          rigours and all pervasive effect of presumption read\n          with limitation of Court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. is\n          not possible to accept in the circumstances of the\n          case.\n\n10.      In the case of               Bharatbhai K. Patel Vs. C. L. Verma\n(supra), this Court has held and observed in para-9 as under:-\n\n          An attempt to rebut legal presumption at initial stage\n          of proceedings is not and cannot be barred but if such\n          an attempt, if made, must be very well founded and\n          above the convincing standard of preponderance of\n          probabilities. The reply to statutory notice is a stage\n          from where it can be shown that the allegations made\n          are absurd, improbable malafide and no prudent\n          person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is\n          sufficient ground to proceed against the accused. In\n          the present case, the petitioner has satisfactorily\n          established the basic infirmity in the complaint and its\n          maintainability. It is obligatory on the part of the\n          accused to rebut the legal presumption but perusal of\n          statement of Mr.C.L.Verma and the stand taken by the\n          associates of Bharat Vijay Mills / Continental Textile\n          Mills in civil litigation including Mr.C.L.Verma referred\n          hereinabove, provides sufficient rebuttal at this stage.\n          Normally, this Court is supposed to read the averments\n          made in the complaint and at the initial stage of the\n          proceedings,            the     High       Court      is    not      justified      in\n          entertaining and accepting the plea that there was no\n          debt or liability. Defence plea cannot be entertained in\n          quashing proceedings. But in the cases where the\n          petitioner is able to show to the Court that there was\n          no existing debt or liability at the time of presentation\n          of the cheque for encashment on the basis of the\n          conduct of the complainant or admissions made by the\n          complainant that may be in other legal proceedings,\n          then in such cases, the proceedings can be terminated\n\n                                               Page  9 of  12         R/CR.MA/20851/2017                                                                                                 JUDGMENT\n\n          and the accused should not be asked to face the trial\n          till it concluded. So, this Court inclined to allow this\n          petition as the petitioner has successfully rebutted the\n          presumption at initial stage and has pointed out the\n          basic infirmity as to maintainability of the proceedings.\n\n11.      Since other decisions relied upon by the learned advocate for\nthe applicant are on the same line and with a view to avoid prolix,\nsame are not referred to in detail.\n\n12.      It is settled law that for considering the petition under Section\n482 of the Code, it is necessary to consider as to whether the\nallegations in the complaint prima facie make out a case or not and\nthe Court is not to scrutinize the allegations for the purpose of\ndeciding whether such allegations are likely to be upheld in trial. It\nis also well settled that though the High Court possesses inherent\npowers under Section 482 of the Code, these powers are meant to\ndo real and substantial justice, for the administration of which alone\nit exists or to prevent abuse of the process of the court. The\nSupreme Court, time and again, has observed that extraordinary\npower should be exercised sparingly and with great care and\ncaution. The High Court would be justified in exercising the said\npower when it is imperative to exercise the same in order to prevent\ninjustice.\n\n13.      The High Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Section\n482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, is required to examine\nwhether the averments in the complaint constitute the ingredients\nnecessary for an offence alleged under the Penal Code. If the\naverments taken on their face do not constitute the ingredients\nnecessary for the offence, the criminal proceedings may be quashed\nunder Section 482. A criminal proceeding can be quashed where the\nallegations made in the complaint do not disclose the commission of\nan offence under the Penal Code. The complaint must be examined\nas a whole, without evaluating the merits of the allegations. Though\n\n                                              Page  10 of  12         R/CR.MA/20851/2017                                                                                                 JUDGMENT\n\nthe law does not require that the complaint reproduce the legal\ningredients of the offence verbatim, the complaint must contain the\nbasic facts necessary for making out an offence under the Penal\nCode.\n\n14.      A court exercising its inherent jurisdiction must examine if on\ntheir face, the averments made in the complaint constitute the\ningredients necessary for the offence.\n\n15.      Now considering the aforesaid legal provisions under Section\n482      of    the     Code        of    Criminal        Procedure          coupled         with      the\nobservations of this Court as well as the Apex Court regarding the\noffence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments\nAct and on perusal of the material available on record, it transpires\nthat after due verification and verifying the record, the learned\nMagistrate has issued summons to the present applicant. The\ngrievance of the applicant is that the cheques were issued in the\nname of the firm and the present complainant has filed the\ncomplaint in his personal capacity. On perusal of the notice issued\nby the complainant to the present accused, it is clearly mentioned\ntherein that he is proprietor of the firm. It also reveals that the\nnotice has been replied by the accused raising various factual\naspects. It is also the case of the applicant that the cheques were\nblank cheques and there were only the signature of the present\naccused. Now, on perusal of the defence put up by the applicant is\nthat his father has also obtained certain amount on interest from\nthe complainant and the same has been repaid and the other\ndefence raised by the accused is that at the initial stage when the\namount received from the complainant, he insisted for blank\ncheques and, therefore, the blank cheques were given to him after\nsigning.  Now, the question of writing on the cheques is concerned,\nthe same is required to be proved or disproved on the evidence that\nmay be led by both the sides. It also reveals from the material on\n\n                                              Page  11 of  12         R/CR.MA/20851/2017                                                                                                 JUDGMENT\n\nrecord that the bank has returned back the cheques to the\ncomplainant with an endorsement of \u2018stop payment\u2019. The applicant\nherein has heavily relied on the bank statement and passbook of his\nown account. However, whatever factual questions raised by the\napplicant are in a nature of defence to the complaint under Section\n138(a) of the Negotiable Instruments Act. This is a case wherein the\ndisputed questions of fact are involved. Under these circumstances,\nwhen there is disputed question of fact is involved and there is\nprima facie material showing that the cheques were issued by the\naccused to the complainant with his signature and there was\nmonetary transaction between them, then in such case, inherent\npowers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot\nbe exercised.\n\n16.      Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, it is\nclearly found that the applicant and his father issued different\ncheques to the complainant and accordingly, the complainant\nlodged       different        complaints          and      he     has      also      initiated       civil\nproceedings. This shows that there is prima facie liability of\npayment on the part of the applicant. In view of the material placed\nin the matter, it clearly appears that this is not a fit case wherein\ninherent powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure could be exercised.\n\n17.      For the foregoing reasons, the present application is devoid of\nmerits and is required to be dismissed. Accordingly, it is dismissed.\nRule is discharged. Interim relief, if any, stands vacated forthwith.\n\n                                                                                            Sd/-\n                                                                                (A. P. THAKER, J)\nV.R. PANCHAL\n\n                                              Page  12 of  12"

By these petitions filed under Section 482 of Cr. P.C., the petitioner \u2013\n\nSudeep Jain is seeking quashing of summoning order dated 29.09.2012\n\npassed by Shri Arul Verma, Metropolitan Magistrate, Patiala House, New\n\nDelhi against him in two complaint cases being CC Nos. 422/1/12 and CC\n\nNos. 423/1/12 titled as M/s. ECE Industries Ltd. vs. GEI Industrial Systems\n\nLtd. and Ors.\n\n2.      Grievance raised by Mr. Krishan Kumar, Advocate appearing for the\n\npetitioner, is that the petitioner is a Company Secretary in the accused\n\ncompany M/s. GEI Industrial Systems Ltd., Bhopal and his duty is restricted\n\nto ensure the proper observance and compliances made by the said company\n\nin terms of various statutory requirements laid down under the Companies\n\nAct. He further submits that the petitioner is neither obliged nor is actually\n\n\n\n  Crl.M.C. No. 1821/2013 & Crl.M.C. No. 1822/2013                                                          Page 2 of 13\n\ninstrumental in the day to day functioning of the said company and in fact\n\nhas no knowledge or any role in the issuance of any cheque on behalf of the\n\nsaid company in favour of the complainant company. It is further the case of\n\nthe petitioner that no specific averments, as to how and in what manner the\n\npetitioner was responsible for the day to day conduct of the business of M/s.\n\nGEI Industrial Systems Ltd., have been made by the complainant company\n\nin the complaint against the petitioner. Counsel for the petitioner also\n\napprises this court that 12 other persons have been issued summons in the\n\nsaid case and some of them have already approached this court for quashing\n\nof the said summoning order.\n\n3.            In support of the above, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that\n\nthe legal position is now well settled                                                          that the liability for an offence\n\npunishable under Section 138 r/w Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments\n\nAct, 1881 will not arise by merely stating that the accused person holds\n\nsome designation in the accused company or by merely reproducing the\n\nlanguage of Section 141 of the Act in the complaint. The complainant has to\n\nmake a specific averment in the complaint as to how and in what manner the\n\nperson            accused               of       the       offence              under            Section              138         of       the       Negotiable\n\n\n\n   Crl.M.C. No. 1821/2013 & Crl.M.C. No. 1822/2013                                                          Page 3 of 13\n\nInstruments Act, 1881 was responsible or had a role in the conduct of the\n\nbusiness of the accused company at the relevant time. A mere fact that the\n\naccused person was a Director or was holding some other office in the\n\ncompany cannot make a person vicariously liable to face the prosecution as\n\nper the mandate of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.\n\n4.            I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner.\n\n5.            Chapter XVII was incorporated in the Negotiable Instruments Act,\n\n1881            by         the         Banking                 Public              Financial                 Institutions                    and          Negotiable\n\nInstruments Laws (Amendment) Act, 1998 with effect from 1.4.1989 for the\n\npurpose               of      imposing                 penalties                in      case          of      dishonor                of       cheque              due         to\n\ninsufficiency of funds in the account of drawer of the cheque, in addition to\n\nthe remedy of filing a recovery suit already available to the aggrieved under\n\nthe civil law. Finding the punishment contained in this chapter inadequate\n\nand the procedure to deal with such matters cumbersome, this chapter was\n\nfurther              amended                   by         the          Negotiable                     Instruments                      (Amendment                          and\n\nMiscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002 for the purpose of early disposal of the\n\ncases related to dishonor of cheques as well as for enhancing punishment for\n\nthe offenders. It would not be inappropriate to say that while this chapter\u2019s\n\n\n   Crl.M.C. No. 1821/2013 & Crl.M.C. No. 1822/2013                                                          Page 4 of 13\n\nintroduction has, on the one hand, reduced the civil litigation to a great\n\nextent, but, on the other hand, has led to the filing of countless complaints\n\nbefore the criminal courts which are mostly against companies, whether\n\nPrivate or Public Ltd., registered under the Companies Act.\n\n6.            Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 deals with the\n\noffences by the companies and says that if an offence has been committed by\n\na company under section 138 Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 then every\n\nperson, who at the time the offence was committed was in charge of, and\n\nwas responsible to the company in the conduct of the business of the\n\ncompany, as well as to the company is liable to be proceeded against and\n\npunished accordingly. What necessary averments are required to be made in\n\nthe complaint to hold any Director or other post holder in the company as\n\nvicariously                 liable          for       an       offence             committed                   under           Section             138         of      the\n\nNegotiable Instruments Act, 1881 by the company has been a subject matter\n\nof discussion in a number of cases. Despite the legal position now being well\n\nsettled with the catena of pronouncements of the Apex Court on this subject,\n\nthe trend set up by the complainants to implead all the Directors, company\n\nsecretaries, etc., of the accused company, irrespective of whether they were\n\n\n\n   Crl.M.C.

One of the earliest case, S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Neeta\n\nBhalla and Anr., 2005 (7) SCALE 397, which threw light on the averments\n\nrequired               to      be        made            in      the        complaint                   under            Section               138         r/w         141          of\n\nNegotiable Instruments Act, observed as follows in paragraph 16:-\n\n                     (a) It is necessary to specifically aver in a complaint under\n                     Section 141 that at the time the offence was committed, the\n                     person accused was in charge of, and responsible for the\n                     conduct of business of the company. This averment is an\n                     essential requirement of Section 141 and has to be made\n                     in a complaint. Without this averment being made in a\n                     complaint, the requirements of Section 141 cannot be said\n                     to be satisfied.\n\n                     (b)...Merely being a director of a company is not sufficient\n                     to make the person liable under Section 141 of the Act. A\n                     director in a company cannot be deemed to be in charge of\n                     and           responsible                     to       the         company                    for         conduct                 of       its\n                     business.                  The           requirement                       of        Section 141 is                        that           the\n                     person sought to be made liable should be in charge of\n                     and responsible for the conduct of the business of the\n                     company at the relevant time. This has to be averred as a\n                     fact as there is no deemed liability of a director in such\n                     cases.\n\n                     (c)\u2026the Managing Director or Joint Managing Director\n                     would              be        admittedly                   in       charge                of       the        company                    and\n                     responsible to the company for conduct of its business.\n                     When that is so, holders of such positions in a company\n                     become liable under Section 141 of the Act. By virtue of\n\n\n\n    Crl.M.C. No. 1821/2013 & Crl.M.C. No. 1822/2013                                                          Page 6 of 13\n\n                    the        office           they          hold          as       Managing                    Director               or       Joint\n                    Managing Director, these persons are in charge of and\n                    responsible for the conduct of business of the company.\n                    Therefore, they get covered under Section 141. So far as\n                    signatory of a cheque which is dishonoured is concerned,\n                    he is clearly responsible for the incriminating act and will\n                    be covered under Sub-section (2) of Section 141.\n\n\n\n7.            Reiterating                  the        same           view,           the        Apex            Court            in      National                Small\n\nIndustries Corp. Ltd. v. Harmeet Singh Paintal and Anr., 2010(2) SCALE\n\n372, further observed that:-\n\n                     24. \u2026if the accused is not one of the persons who falls\n                    under the category of \"persons who are responsible to the\n                    company for the conduct of the business of the company\"\n                    then merely by stating that \"he was in-charge of the\n                    business of the company\" or by stating that \"he was in-\n                    charge of the day-to-day management of the company\" or\n                    by stating that \"he was in-charge of, and was responsible\n                    to the company for the conduct of the business of the\n                    company\", he cannot be made vicariously liable under\n                    Section 141(1) of the Act. To put it clear that for making a\n                    person              liable            under              Section 141(2),                          the         mechanical\n                    repetition of the requirements under Section 141(1) will be\n                    of no assistance, but there should be necessary averments\n                    in      the complaint                        as      to      how          and         in what manner the\n                    accused                was           guilty            of       consent                and           connivance                     or\n                    negligence and therefore, responsible under Sub-section\n                    (2) of Section 141 of the Act.\n\n\n\n\n\n   Crl.M.C. No. 1821/2013 & Crl.M.C. No. 1822/2013                                                          Page 7 of 13\n\nSummarizing the legal position, The Apex court further laid down\n\nthe following principles:-\n\n            (i) The primary responsibility is on the complainant to\n            make specific averments as are required under the law in\n            the complaint so as to make the accused vicariously liable.\n            For     fastening        the     criminal       liability,     there      is   no\n            presumption          that    every      Director       knows       about       the\n            transaction.\n\n            (ii) Section 141 does not make all the Directors liable for\n            the offence. The criminal liability can be fastened only on\n            those who, at the time of the commission of the offence,\n            were in charge of and were responsible for the conduct of\n            the business of the company.\n\n            (iii) Vicarious liability can be inferred against a company\n            registered or incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956\n            only if the requisite statements, which are required to be\n            averred in the complaint/petition, are made so as to make\n            accused therein vicariously liable for offence committed by\n            company along with averments in the petition containing\n            that accused were in-charge of and responsible for the\n            business of the company and by virtue of their position\n            they are liable to be proceeded with.\n\n            (iv)Vicarious liability on the part of a person must be\n            pleaded and proved and not inferred.\n\n            (v) If accused is Managing Director or Joint Managing\n            Director then it is not necessary to make specific averment\n            in the complaint and by virtue of their position they are\n            liable to be proceeded with.\n\n\n\n  Crl.M.C. No. 1821/2013 & Crl.M.C. No. 1822/2013                                                          Page 8 of 13\n\n            (vi)If accused is a Director or an Officer of a company\n            who signed the cheques on behalf of the company then\n            also it is not necessary to make specific averment in\n            complaint.\n\n            (vii) The person sought to be made liable should be in-\n            charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business\n            of the company at the relevant time. This has to be averred\n            as a fact as there is no deemed liability of a Director in\n            such          cases.\n\n\n8.      The recent judgments of the Apex Court namely, Anita Malhotra v.\n\nApparel export Promotion Council and Anr., (2011) 1 SCC 520 and Laxmi\n\nDyechem v. State of Gujrat and Ors., 2012 (11) SCALE 365, have again\n\nreiterated the said legal position.\n\n9.      The prime objective of this Court is to remind all the Metropolitan\n\nMagistrates in Delhi to carefully scrutinize all the complaint cases being\n\nfiled under Section 138 r/w 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\nagainst the accused companies at the pre-summoning stage and make sure\n\nthat notice be directed only to those directors or employees of the company\n\nwho satisfy the principles laid down in the aforesaid judgments. Summons\n\nmust be issued only after giving due consideration to the allegations and the\n\nmaterials placed on record by the complainant. Undeniably, as per the\n\n\n\n  Crl.M.C. No. 1821/2013 & Crl.M.C. No. 1822/2013                                                          Page 9 of 13\n\naforesaid legal pronouncements, Managing Director and the Joint Managing\n\nDirector are deemed to be vicariously liable for the offence committed by\n\nthe company because of the position they hold in the company. Problem\n\narises in cases where all the persons holding office in the company are\n\nsought to be prosecuted by the complainant, irrespective of whether they\n\nplayed any specific role in the incriminating act. It is surprising to see that in\n\nplethora of cases, the complaint contains allegations even against those\n\npersons who might have been Directors at any point in time in the accused\n\ncompany, but had resigned from such company much prior to the period\n\nwhen the alleged offence was committed. Issuing summons to all persons\n\nnamed in the complaint mechanically, without ascertaining whether they\n\nplayed any actual role in the transaction, not only pesters the innocent\n\ndirectors/employees named in the complaint, but also upsurges the load on\n\nthe High Courts as the Magistrates once issuing the summoning orders\n\nagainst the accused, are precluded from reviewing their summoning orders\n\nin view of the decision of the Apex Court in Adalat Prasad v. Rooplal\n\nJindal and Ors., (2004) 7 SCC 338. One can also not lose sight of the fact\n\nthat once such innocent persons are summoned, they have no choice but to\n\n\n\n Crl.M.C. No. 1821/2013 & Crl.M.C. No. 1822/2013                                                          Page 10 of 13\n\nseek bail and face the ordeal of trial. Many of such persons also approach the\n\nHigh Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to seek quashing of the summoning\n\norder and the complaint filed against them and this further increases the\n\nburden on the already overburdened Courts.\n\n10.            With a view to ensure that the Metropolitan Magistrates dealing with\n\nthe       complaint                   cases           filed         under            Section               138         r/w         Section              141          of      the\n\nNegotiable Instruments Act have a clear and complete picture of the persons\n\narrayed by the complainant so as to hold them vicariously liable for the\n\ncommission of the offence by the accused company, I am inclined to direct\n\nthat the Magistrates must seek copies of Form-32 from the complainant to\n\nprima facie satisfy the Court as to who were the directors of the accused\n\ncompany at the time of commission of the alleged offence and on the date of\n\nfiling of the complaint case. In addition to the above, the Magistrates must\n\nalso seek information as given in the following table which is to be annexed\n\nby the Complainant on a separate sheet accompanying the complaint:-\n\n\n\n Crl.M.C.

The petitioner is an accused in a case under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act on the file of the learned Judicial  Magistrate I, Erode.  He filed a petition under section 45 of the Evidence Act to send the disputed cheque for comparison by an expert to determine the age of the ink of the signature found in the disputed cheque marked as Ex.P1 before the Trial Court.  It is his contention that the signature found in Ex.P1 has been put in a different ink from that of the other particulars filled in the cheque.  It is his further contention that he issued blank cheques and pronotes with his signature therein.  But, the same has been filled and misused by the respondent.  Therefore, the petitioner has prayed for sending the disputed cheque, Ex.P1 to the Forensic Laboratory at Hyderabad to determine the age of the ink of the signature of the petitioner. The trial court has rejected such a plea on the ground that there is no necessity to send the disputed cheque for expert's opinion as the signature found therein had been categorically admitted by the petitioner. \n\t3. The points that arise for determination are \ni) \tWhether the scope of section 20 of the Negotiable Instruments Act applies to blank cheque signed by the drawer. \nii) \tWhether a blank cheque signed by the drawer can be filled up by a holder thereof. \niii)\tWhether the disputed document can be sent to an expert for ascertaining the age of the signature found therein.\n\t4. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner vehemently submits that a holder of a cheque has no authority to fill up the blank cheque signed by the drawer, inasmuch as section 20 of the Negotiable Instruments Act has no application to a cheque issued by a drawer.  He would further contend that a cheque will have to be filled up and signed only by the drawer as section 20 would apply only to the other instruments viz., pronotes and bill of exchange.  As the petitioner seriously disputes the negotiability of the cheque in question inasmuch as the particulars found in the cheque were filled up later on by the respondent to suit his convenience, a fair opportunity will have to be given to the petitioner to rebut the claim of the respondent. \n\t5. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent would submit that this court has held that a blank cheque can be filled up by a holder in due course.  When the signature found in the cheque is admitted, the petitioner cannot challenge the particulars filled up by the holder in due course in the cheque.  At any rate, he would submit that there is no perfect science to determine the age of the ink used in a document. \n\t6. Section 20 of the Negotiable Instruments Act reads as follows:-\n\"Inchoate stamped instruments-- Where one person signs and delivers to another a paper stamped in accordance with the law relating to negotiable instruments then in force in India, and either wholly blank or having written thereon an incomplete negotiable instrument, he thereby gives prima facie authority to the holder thereof to make or complete, as the case may be, upon it a negotiable instrument, for any amount specified therein and not exceeding the amount covered by the stamp.  The person so signing shall be liable upon such instrument, in the capacity in which he signed the same, to any holder in due course for such amount: provided that no person other than a holder in due course shall recover from the person delivering the instrument anything in excess of the amount intended by him to be paid thereunder.\"\nA bare reading of section 20 of the Negotiable Instruments act would go to show that it would apply to only a stamped instrument viz., pronote and bill of exchange and not to the cheques.  As per section 20 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, the holder in due course has every authority to complete the blank pronote and bill of exchange delivered to him after properly signing therein by the maker of the instrument.  But, section 20 will have no application to the blank cheques issued after signing by the drawer. \n\t7. This court in RAJENDRAN v. USHARANI (2001-LW (Crl.) 319) has observed that no law prescribes that in case of any negotiable instrument, the entire body of the instrument shall be written only by the marker or drawer of the instrument.  Once the execution is admitted, it shall be taken that the cheque was issued by the accused in favour of the complainant towards the discharge of the liability even in a case where the cheque was filled up by some other person. \n\t8. It is to be noted that there is no reference to section 20 of the Negotiable Instruments Act in the aforesaid authority.  A general proposition has been made to the effect that there is a presumption, in case a signed cheque is delivered to  the payee, that the cheque so issued by the drawer in favour of the payee is only towards the discharge of his subsisting liability. \n\t9. The aforesaid authority does not run counter to the provision under section 20 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.  As rightly observed therein, there is no law which prescribes that a cheque shall be filled up by the drawer himself.  If such proposition is accepted, no unlettered person, who knows only to sign his name, can ever be a drawer of a cheque.  Further, a person who is physically incapacitated  to fill up the cheque cannot also draw a cheque and negotiate it.  Of course, as far as the other negotiable instruments viz., pronotes and bills of exchange, there is a clear mandate under section 20 of the Negotiable Instruments Act to the effect that such an instrument can be negotiated by the maker thereof by simply signing and delivering the same to the holder in due course giving thereby ample authority to the latter to fill up the content of the instrument as intended by the maker thereof. \n\t10. Even in case of a cheque, as there is no clear provision in the Negotiable Instruments Act, in the light of the above discussion, the court finds that if a drawer of a cheque gives authority to the payee or holder in due course or a stranger for that matter to fill up the cheque signed by him, such an instrument also is valid in the eye of law. There is no bar for the drawer of a cheque to give authority to a third person to fill up the cheque signed by him for the purpose of negotiating the same. \n\t11. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, referred to an authority in KALYANI BASKAR v. M.S.SAMPOORNAM (2007(2) CTC 364) wherein the Honourable Supreme Court observed as follows:-\n\"Section 243(2) is clear that a Magistrate holding an inquiry under the Cr.P.C. in respect of an offence triable by him does not exceed his powers under Section 243(2) if, in the interest of justice, he directs to send the document for enabling the same to be compared by a hand-writing expert because  even in adopting this course, the purpose is to enable the Magistrate to compare the disputed signature or writing with the admitted writing or signature of the accused and to reach his own conclusion with the assistance of the expert.  The appellant is entitled to rebut the case of the respondent and if the document viz., the cheque on which the respondent has relied upon for initiating criminal proceedings against the appellant would furnish good material for rebutting the case, the Magistrate having declined to send the document for the examination and opinion of the hand-writing expert has deprived the appellant of an opportunity of rebutting it.  The appellant cannot be convicted without an opportunity being given to her to present her evidence and if it is denied to her, there is no fair trial.  'Fair trial' includes fair  and proper opportunities allowed by law to prove her innocence.  Adducing evidence in support of the defence is a valuable right. Denial of that right means denial of fair trial.  It is essential that rules of procedure designed to ensure justice should be scrupulously followed, and Courts should be jealous in seeing that there is no breach of them.  We have not been able to appreciate the view of the learned Judge of the High Court that the petitioner has filed application under Section 243, Cr.P.C. without naming any person as witness or anything to be summoned, which are to be sent for handwriting expert for examination.  As noticed above, Section 243(2), Cr.P.C. refers to a stage when the prosecution closes its evidence after examining the witnesses and the accused has entered upon his defence.  The appellant in this case requests for sending the cheque, in question, for the opinion of the hand-writing expert after the respondent has closed her evidence, the Magistrate should have granted such a request unless he thinks that the object of the appellant is  vexation or delaying the criminal proceedings.  In such circumstances, the order of the High Court impugned in this Appeal upholding the order of the Magistrate is erroneous and not sustainable.\"\nIn a case where the signature of the cheque was in dispute in a prosecution under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, the Honourable Supreme Court has observed that denial of an opportunity to the accused seeking to send the disputed cheque for examination and opinion of handwriting expert would amount to unfair trial and deprivation of an opportunity to the accused to rebut the claim of the complainant.  The aforesaid ratio cannot be extended to the facts and circumstances of this case where the signature in the disputed cheque was candidly admitted by the accused. \n\t12. Following the aforesaid ratio, this court has also held in P.R.RAMAKRISHNAN v. P.GOVINDARAJAN ((2007) 1 MLJ (Crl.) 1297 that when the accused disputes his signature in the cheque in question in a proceeding under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, the court has to afford an opportunity to the accused to obtain an expert's opinion as to the genuineness or otherwise of the signature found therein. The above ratio will not apply to a case where a cheque admittedly signed by the drawer is sought to be analysed by an expert for opinion as to the age of the ink used in the cheque.\n\t13. In YASH PAL v. KARTAR SINGH (AIR 2003 Punjab and Haryana 344), it has been observed that the age of the ink cannot be determined on the basis of the writing if the ink in dispute was manufactured five years prior to the date of execution of the document and used effectively on a particular date for the first time and an expert's opinion as to the age of ink will not resolve any controversy, but, it will help to create only confusion.  \n\t14. As rightly observed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court in the ratio referred to above, if an old ink is used by the person, who assisted the drawer who had already put his signature in the cheque, to fill up the matter, no useful purpose will be served if such a cheque is analysed by the expert for rendering an opinion. \n\t15. It is found that the age of the ink cannot be determined by an expert with scientific accuracy.  Further, the use of old ink manufactured long ago will definitely create a dent in the opinion furnished by an expert.  Therefore, there is no necessity for sending the disputed cheque admittedly signed by the petitioner to an expert for his opinion.  The order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate I, Erode in C.M.PNo.2915 of 2007 in C.C.No.1287 of 2006 does not suffer from any illegality or  impropriety. Therefore, there is no warrant for interference with the well considered order passed by the Trial Court. \n\t16. In view of the above, the order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate is confirmed.  The criminal revision case stands dismissed. The connected Miscellaneous Petition also stands dismissed. \n\n\n\n\nssk. \n\nTo\n\nJudicial Magistrate I, \nErode. \n"

The aforesaid case is instituted upon the complaint\n\nfiled against the petitioner by the first respondent for an offence\n\npunishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,\n\n1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').\n\n        3.      When the trial of the case reached the stage of\n\ndefence evidence, DW1 was examined on the side of the\n\npetitioner/accused and documents were also marked on his side\n\nand the evidence in the case was closed and the case was posted\n\nfor final hearing.               Then, the petitioner/accused                      filed    two\n\napplications as Crl.M.P.Nos.877/2019 and 878/2019 in the trial\n\ncourt.Crl.M.C.No.1546/2020                            3\n\n        4.      The application Crl.M.P.No.877/2019 was filed under\n\nSection 311 Cr.P.C for re-opening the evidence in the case.  The\n\napplication Crl.M.P.No.878/2019 was filed by the petitioner for\n\nsending  the cheque for expert opinion.\n\n        5.      The petitioner alleged in the aforesaid applications\n\nthat he is not the author of the entries made in the cheque and\n\nthat the complainant has stated on cross-examination that, he\n\nhas the belief that the handwriting of the entries in the cheque\n\nbelongs to the petitioner.  Therefore, the petitioner prayed for\n\nsending the cheque for expert opinion.\n\n        6.      As per Annexure-A order, the learned Magistrate\n\ndismissed both applications.  The aforesaid order is challenged in\n\nthis petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\n\n        7.      Heard learned counsel for the petitioner.\n\n        8.      Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the\n\npetitioner is not the author of the entries made in the cheque and\n\nin order to prove that fact, it is absolutely necessary to send the\n\ncheque for expert opinion.Crl.M.C.No.1546/2020                            4\n\n        9.      The trial court has dismissed the application for\n\nsending the cheque for expert opinion, by stating as follows:\n\n                        \u201cFrom the cross-examination of PW1, it can\n                be seen that, PW1 has categorically deposed that,\n                accused came with Ext.P1 cheque after filling the\n                same and put his signature in the same, in front of\n                PW1.  He has further deposed that, he did not see\n                filling of Ext.P1 cheque and he does not know who\n                wrote Ext.P1 cheque.  It is true that, PW1 has at\n                one time, in his cross-examination, deposed that,\n                he has belief that, Ext.P1 cheque was written by\n                accused.        At the same time, he has further\n                deposed that, he did not see the accused filling\n                Ext.P1 cheque.  PW1 has no case that, he has\n                acquaintance with the handwriting of accused.  In\n                considering the evidence of PW1 as a whole, it can\n                be seen that, complainant has no case that, Ext.P1\n                cheque was written by accused himself.  Only on\n                the ground that, at one time, PW1 has deposed\n                that, he has belief that, accused has written Ext.P1\n                cheque, it cannot be said that, complainant has\n                the    case    that,     accused       himself     wrote      Ext.P1\n                cheque.  In the said circumstances, no purpose will\n                be served in sending Ext.P1 cheque to an expert to\n                compare the handwriting of accused with the\n                handwriting        seen      in   Ext.P1      cheque.          SinceCrl.M.C.No.1546/2020                            5\n\n                complainant has no specific case that accused\n                himself wrote Ext.P1 cheque, there is no necessity\n                to send Ext.P1 cheque to an expert to compare the\n                handwriting of accused with the handwriting seen\n                in Ext.P1 cheque.  Hence CMP 878/2019 is only to\n                be dismissed.\u201d\n        10.     A perusal of the order of the learned Magistrate would\n\nshow that the complainant has got no plea that the accused\n\nhimself filled up the cheque in his own handwriting or that the\n\naccused is the author of the entries in the cheque except the\n\nsignature. The petitioner/accused has also no case that he had\n\nfilled up the cheque by himself. In such circumstances, no\n\npurpose would be served by sending the cheque for expert\n\nopinion to ascertain whether the entries in the cheque have been\n\nmade by the accused or not in his own handwriting.\n\n        11.     In the aforesaid situation, I find no illegality or\n\nimpropriety in the impugned order passed by the learned\n\nMagistrate.  The petition is liable to be dismissed.\n\n        Consequently, the petition is dismissed.\n\n                                                                (sd/-)\n                                          R.NARAYANA PISHARADI, JUDGE\njsrCrl.M.C.No.1546/2020                            6\n\n                                       APPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE A                      TRUE COPY OF ORDER DATED 17.01.2020 IN\n                                C.M.P 878 IN S.T.NO.14 OF 2017.\n\nRESPONDENTS' EXHIBITS :  NIL\n\n                 TRUE COPY\n                                      PS TO JUDGE"

According to the complainant, the cheque in question for an\namount of Rs.1.5 Crores was issued on behalf of the first accused\nCompany (M/s.Team Sustain Ltd.) and accused Nos. 2 to 5 were stated\nto be the directors of the first accused Company who were actively\ninvolved in the day to day affairs of  the running of the Company.\n        3.      It is now pointed out by Sri.Denu Joseph, learned counsel\nappearing for the petitioners, that the second petitioner herein (accused\nNo.5) is no more and that his name may be struck out from the party\narray.\n        4.      In view of the submission made on behalf of the second\npetitioner/5th accused, it is ordered that the Registry will ensure that theCrl.M.C.No.3955/2013                             :2:\n\nname of the second petitioner is deleted from the party array.\n        5.      The basic contention urged by the petitioner is that the\nimpugned Annexure A complaint has been filed by the first respondent\nwithout fulfilling the mandatory requirement of statutory notice under\nclause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 as well as Section 93 of the\nNegotiable Instruments Act.  It is alleged that the court below has\nproceeded to take cognizance and issued summons to the accused\nwithout considering the crucial aspect regarding lack of statutory notice\nto the accused.  It is urged that Annexure B notice has been issued by\nthe first respondent only to the first accused Company and not to the\nother four accused who are alleged to be the directors of the Company.\nAccordingly, it is urged that the action of the court below in taking\ncognizance and issuing summons to the petitioner is illegal and\nultravires, etc.\n        6.      Heard Sri.Denu Joseph, learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioner/accused, Sri.V.Abraham Markos, learned counsel appearing\nfor the first respondent/complainant and Sri.Saigi Jacob Palatty, learned\nprosecutor appearing for the second respondent/State.\n        7.      It is the case of the complainant that the complaint has\nbeen instituted on the basis of the cheque in question which has been\nissued to meet the liability of the first accused Company.  Further it isCrl.M.C.No.3955/2013                             :3:\n\nthe case of the complainant that accused Nos.2 to 4 are the directors of\nthe first accused Company who are actively running the day to day\naffairs of the said Company and that therefore, they are also vicariously\nliable in terms of the provisions contained in Section 141 of the\nNegotiable Instruments Act.  The issue as to whether the individual\ndirectors of the Company are who arrayed as co-accused in cases\nwhere the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act\nis alleged against the Company, should be given demand notice as per\nSection 138 proviso (b) has been considered and decided by the Apex\nCourt in the case Kirshna Texport & Capital Markets Ltd. V. Ila\nA.Agrawal  and others reported in 2015 (2) KLT 543 = 2015 (2) KLJ\n534 = 2015 (2) KHC 793 = (2015) 8 SCC 28.  A contention was urged\nthat it has been held earlier by the Apex Court in the case N.K.Wahi v.\nShekhar Singh and others reported in (2007) 9 SCC 481 = AIR 2007\nSC 1454 =  (2007) 3 SCC (Cri.) 203 that it was obligatory to issue\nseparate notices to the directors in addition to the notice to the\nCompany.  Considering the issue, the Supreme Court held in Kirshna\nTexport & Capital Markets Ltd.'s case (Supra)                        that   the reason for\ncreating vicarious liability is plainly that a juristic entity, that is a\nCompany would be run by living persons who are in charge of its affairs\nand who guided the actions of that  Company and that if such juristicCrl.M.C.No.3955/2013                             :4:\n\nentity is guilty, those who were so responsible for its affairs and who\nguided  actions of such juristic entity must be held responsible and\nought to be proceeded against. Section 141 of the Negotiable\nInstruments Act again does not lay down any requirement that in such\neventuality, the directors must individually be issued separate notices\nunder Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and the persons\nwho are in charge of the affairs of the Company and running its affairs,\nmust naturally be aware of the notice of demand under Section 138 of\nthe  Act issued to such Company.  It is precisely for this reason that no\nnotice is additionally contemplated to be given to such directors and that\nthe opportunity to the \u201cdrawer\u201d Company is considered good enough for\nthose who are in charge of the affairs of such Company and if it is their\ncase that the offence was committed without their knowledge or that\nthey had exercised due diligence to prevent such commission, it would\nbe a matter of defence to be considered at the appropriate stage in the\ntrial and certainly not at the stage of notice under Section 138.   Section\n138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act does not admit of any necessity\nor scope for reading into it the requirement that the directors of the\nCompany in question must also be issued individual notices under\nSection 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and such directors who\nare in charge of affairs of the Company and responsible for the affairs ofCrl.M.C.No.3955/2013                             :5:\n\nthe Company would be aware of the receipt of notice by the Company\nunder Section 138.             Therefore, it was held that neither on literal\nconstruction nor on the touch stone of purposive construction such\n\nrequirement could or ought to be read into Section  138 of the Act. It\nwas also held in paragraph 9 of Kirshna Texport & Capital Markets Ltd.'s\ncase (Supra) that the Apex Court in N.K.Wahi's case (Supra) has not\nconsidered this issue at all, etc.\n        8.      Going by the legal principles laid down by the Apex Court in\nKirshna Texport & Capital Markets Ltd. v. Ila A.Agrawal  and others\n(Supra), notice to the drawer Company should be treated as\nconstructive notices on all the other directors or in charge of the affairs\nof the Company, as they are in charge of the day to day affairs of the\nsaid Company. It will be profitable to refer to paragraphs 13 to 16 of the\nsaid judgment of the Apex Court in Kirshna Texport & Capital Markets\nLtd. v. Ila A.Agrawal  and others (Supra), which read as follows :\n\n                \u201c13.     With these principles in mind, we now consider the\n        provisions in question. According to S.138, where any cheque drawn by\n        a person on an account maintained by him is returned by the Bank\n        unpaid for reasons mentioned in said Section such person shall be\n        deemed to have committed an offence. The proviso to the Section\n        stipulates three conditions on the satisfaction of which the offence is\n        said to be completed. The proviso inter alia obliges the payee to make a\n        demand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice\n        in writing to \u201cthe drawer of the cheque\u201d and if \u201cthe drawer of the cheque\u201d\n        fails to make the payment of the said amount within 15 days of the\n        receipt of said notice, the stages stipulated in the proviso stand fulfilled.\n        The notice under S.138 is required to be given to \u201cthe drawer\u201d of the\n        cheque so as to give the drawer an opportunity to make the paymentCrl.M.C.No.3955/2013                             :6:\n\n        and escape the penal consequences. No other person is contemplated\n        by S.138 as being entitled to be issued such notice. The plain language\n        of S.138 is very clear and leaves no room for any doubt or ambiguity.\n        There is nothing in S.138 which may even remotely suggest issuance of\n        notice to anyone other than the drawer.\n                14.      S.141 states that if the person committing an offence\n        under S.138 is a  Company, every director of such Company who was in\n        charge of and responsible to that Company for conduct of its business\n        shall also be deemed to be guilty. The reason for creating vicarious\n        liability is plainly that  a juristic entity i.e. a Company would be run by\n        living persons who are in charge of its affairs and who guide the actions\n        of that Company and that if such juristic entity is guilty, those who were\n        so responsible for its affairs and who guided actions of such juristic\n        entity must be held responsible and ought to be proceeded against.\n        S.141 again does not lay down any requirement that in such eventuality\n        the directors must individually be issued separate notices under S.138.\n        The persons who are in charge of the affairs of the Company and\n        running its affairs must naturally be aware of the notice of demand\n        under S.138 of the Act issued to such Company. It is precisely for this\n        reason that no notice is additionally contemplated to be given to such\n        directors. The opportunity to the 'drawer' Company is considered good\n        enough for those who are in charge of the affairs of such Company. If it\n        is their case that the offence was committed without their knowledge or\n        that they had exercised due diligence to prevent such commission, it\n        would be a matter of defence to be considered at the appropriate stage\n        in the trial and certainly not at the stage of notice under S.138.\n                15.      If the requirement that such individual notices to the\n        directors must additionally be given is read into the concerned\n        provisions, it will not only be against the plain meaning and construction\n        of the provision but will make the remedy under S.138 wholly\n        cumbersome. In a given case the ordinary lapse or negligence on part\n        of the Company could easily be rectified and amends could be made\n        upon receipt of a notice under S.138 by the Company. It would be\n        unnecessary at that point to issue notices to all the directors, whose\n        names the payee may not even be aware of at that stage. Under\n        Second proviso to S.138, the notice of demand has to be made within\n        30 days of the dishonour of cheque and the third proviso gives 15 days\n        time to the drawer to make the payment of the amount and escape the\n        penal consequence. Under Clause (a) of S.142, the complaint must be\n        filed within one month of the date on which the cause of action arises\n        under the third proviso to S.138. Thus a complaint can be filed within\n        the aggregate period of seventy five days from the dishonour, by which\n        time a complainant can gather requisite information as regards names\n        and other details as to who were in charge of and how they were\n        responsible for the affairs of the Company. But if we accept the logic\n        that has weighed with the High Court in the present case, such period\n        gets reduced to 30 days only. Futhermore, unlike proviso to Clause (b)Crl.M.C.No.3955/2013                             :7:\n\n        of S.142 of the Act, such period is non-extendable. The summary\n        remedy created for the benefit of a drawee of a dishonoured cheque will\n        thus be rendered completely cumbersome and capable of getting\n        frustrated.\n                16.      In our view, S.138 of the Act does not admit of any\n        necessity or scope for reading into it the requirement that the directors\n        of the Company in question must also be issued indiviudual notices\n        under S.138 of the Act. Such directors who are in charge of affairs of\n        the Company and responsible for the affairs of the Company would be\n        aware of the receipt of notice by the Company under S.138. Therefore\n        neither on literal contruction nor on the touch stone of purposive\n        construction such requirement could or ought to be read into S.138 of\n        the Act. Consequently this appeal must succeed. The order passed by\n        the High Court is set aside. Since the matter was at the stage of\n        considering application for leave to appeal and the merits of the matter\n        were not considered by the High Court, we remit the matter to the High\n        Court for fresh consideration which may be decided as early as\n        possible. Concluding so, we must record that the decision of the\n        Division Bench of the Madras High Court in B.Raman and Others\n        v.M/s.Shasun Chemicals and Drugs Ltd. (supra) was incorrect and it\n        stands overruled. The appeal is allowed in these terms.\u201d\n\n        9.      A similar view has also been earlier taken by this Court in\nthe judgments in Target  Overseas Exports (P) Ltd. V. Iqbal reported\nin 2005 KHC 530 and Susan Zachariah and others v. M/s.Muthoot\nCapital Services Ltd. and another reported in 2012 (3) KHC 870, etc.\nthat once under Section 138 proviso (b) statutory notice has been\nissued to the drawer Company, there is no necessity to issue separate\nnotices to the individual directors who was sought to be vicariously liable\nfor the action of the Company in question, etc. Madras High Court in the\ncase Raman v. Shashun Chemicals reported in 2006 Crl.L.J. 4552\nhad taken a contra position and the said view of the judgment of the\nMadras High Court has also been referred to in paragraph 4 of theCrl.M.C.No.3955/2013                             :8:\n\njudgment of the Apex Court in Kirshna Texport & Capital Markets Ltd.\nv. Ila A.Agrawal  and others (Supra) and the said view of the Madras\nHigh Court has not been accepted by the Supreme Court, etc.\n        10.     However, Sri.Denu Joseph,  learned  counsel  appearing\nfor the petitioner, would further contend that the Apex Court has not\nconsidered  the  impact of Section 93 of  the  Negotiable Instruments\nAct, 1881 and that therefore, the said judgment of the Apex Court  is\nper  incuriam, etc.  Section 93 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\nreads as follows :\n          \u201c93.  By and to whom notice should be given :- When a promissory\n                note, bill of exchange or cheque is dishonoured by non-\n                acceptance or non-payment, the holder thereof, or some party\n                thereto who remains liable thereon, must give notice that the\n                instrument has been so dishonoured to all other parties whom the\n                holder seeks to make severally liable thereon, and to some one\n                of several parties whom he seeks to make  jointly liable thereon.\n                        Nothing in this section renders it necessary to give notice\n                to the maker of the dishonoured promissory note, or the drawee\n                or acceptor of the dishonoured billl of exchange or cheque.\u201d\n\n        11.     On a reading of the abovesaid Apex Court judgment in\nKirshna Texport & Capital Markets Ltd. V. Ila A.Agrawal  and others\n(Supra), this Court is not inclined to accept the plea made by the\npetitioner that the said judgment is per incuriam merely because it does\nnot refer to the provision contained in Section 93 of the Negotiable\nInstruments Act.  The law laid down by the Apex Court is binding on all\nauthorities and fora including this Court by virtue of the mandateCrl.M.C.No.3955/2013                             :9:\n\ncontained in Article 141 of the Constitution of India.  Therefore, this\nCourt is of the view that the said plea taken up by the petitioner cannot\nbe countenanced.  That apart, this Court is of the view that for making\nout a criminal offence under Section 138 of Chapter XVII of the\nNegotiable Instruments Act, the provisions contained in that Section as\nwell as in other related provisions in that Chapter will be the special law\nthat governs the field. So far complying with the requirement of demand\nnotice before institution of the criminal complaint for such offence, only\nthe requirements in Section 138 proviso need alone be complied with.\nIn such cases, the provisions in Section 93 contained in Chapter VII of\nthe Negotiable Instruments Act cannot be viewed as mandatory and can\nonly be seen as directory, as far as the requirements of demand notice\nfor the cause of action in respect of the criminal offence in Section 138\nof the Act.\n        12.     Accordingly, it is only to be held that the contentions urged\nby the petitioner are devoid of any merit.  However, it is made clear that\nif the petitioner has the case that the alleged offence was committed\nwithout his knowledge or that he had exercised all due diligence to\nprevent the commision of such offence or any other valid defence, that\nwould be a matter of evidence to be considered at the appropriate stage\nof the trial and not at this stage and any such contentions of theCrl.M.C.No.3955/2013                              :10:\n\npetitioner are reserved to be raised by him at the appropriate stage\nbefore the trial court.\n        With these observations and directions, the Crl.M.C. stands\ndismissed.\n\n                                                                ALEXANDER THOMAS\n                                                                          JUDGE\ncsl\n\n"

A1 was no more at the time of trial itself.                                                                 The\n\ncomplainant's case is that a sum of Rs.60,000/- was borrowed\n\nfrom him by the accused on 24.3.1995 and towards discharge of\n\nthe       same, the impugned                                   cheque was issued                                which           when\n\npresented got dishonoured for want of funds in the account of the\n\naccused.  The lawyer notice sent demanding payment was not\n\nreplied to nor was any amount paid.\n\n           3.         The evidence adduced in the matter consisted the\n\ntestimony of PWs' 1 to 3 and Exts. P1 to P10.  The defence\n\nexamined DW1 and DW2 of whom DW2 is the second accused\n\nhimself and marked Exts. D1 to D4.\n\n           4.         The case of the defence is that only a sum ofCrl.A.NO.454/1999                                          Page numbers\n\nRs.20,000/- was borrowed and out of which Rs.19,000/- was\n\nrepaid and that there was a dispute with respect to the interest\n\ndue and hence the blank cheque issued at the time of the\n\nborrowal has been misused by incorporating the amount of\n\nRs.60,000/-.                  According to the defence at the time of the\n\ntransaction a pro-note was executed, the original of which\n\naccording to the accused is with the complainant.  According to\n\nthe defence, it is the case that in the agreement the amount is\n\nmentioned as Rs.40,000/-.  They have also produced the copy of\n\nthe agreement, i.e., Ext. D1, Ext. D2 photo copy of the blank\n\ncheque, Ext. D3 reply notice sent raising the above contentions\n\nwhich was received by the complainant who is the brother of the\n\naccused after filing of the complaint and Ext. D4 acknowledgment\n\ncard. The court below has relied on certain circumstances that\n\nhas brought out in the evidence in order to non suit the\n\ncomplaint.  The relevant fact is that the cheque was presented\n\njust on the brink of the expiry of the validity of the date of the\n\ncheque.              The         cheque              dated            25.8.1995                 was         presented                 on\n\n15.2.1996. There is no explanation for not presenting the cheque\n\nat about six months after the date of the cheque.  The aboveCrl.A.NO.454/1999                         Page numbers\n\ncircumstance is fortified by the fact that Ext. D1 photo copy of the\n\nagreement which is dated 24.3.1995 is the pro-note that support\n\nthe defence case and Ext. D1 contains the cheque number as\n\nwell.  The photocopy of the blank cheque is Ext. D2.  The lower\n\ncourt has also noted that the writings of the details in the cheque\n\nis different from signature i.e., with respect to the ink used.  It\n\nwas on the basis of the cumulative effect of the entire\n\ncircumstances that court found that the defence has established a\n\nprobable case and that the complainant has failed to establish the\n\nexecution of the cheque.\n\n        5.      In the above circumstances, I find no reason to\n\ninterfere in the findings of the court below in exercise of the\n\nappellate jurisdiction against acquittal.\n\n        The appeal is dismissed.\n\n                                                                     K.R.UDAYABHANU,\n                                                                                   JUDGE\n\ncsl"

No.168/2004 on the\nfile of the J.F.C.M.-II, Alappuzha challenges  the conviction  entered and\nthe sentence passed against  him for an offence punishable under  Sec.\n138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as\n'the Act').\n        2.      I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and\nthe learned Public Prosecutor.\n        3.      The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner\nre-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision.  The courts below\nhave concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the\nrevision petitioner in favour of the  complainant on the drawee bank, that\nthe cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured\nfor reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the\ncomplainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in\naccordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act  and\nthat the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment  within\n15 days of receipt of the statutory notice.                       Both the courts have\nconsidered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner\nwhile  entering the above finding.   The said finding has been recordedCrl.R.P.No.3292/07\n                                              : 2 :\n\non an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence.  I do  not find\nany error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently\nby the courts below.  The conviction was thus rightly entered against\nthe  petitioner.\n        4.      What now survives for consideration is the question as to\nwhether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision\nPetitioner.  I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on\nthe revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition\nhereinafter mentioned.  Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the\n1st respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357\n(3) Cr.P.C. a sum of Rs.70,000/- (Rupees seventy thousand only) within\nfour months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till\nthe rising of the court.  If on the other hand, the revision petitioner\ncommits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo\nsimple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence.\nMoney, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if\nany, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the\nrevision petitioner.\n        This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but\nmodifying the sentence as above.\n\n                                                             (V.

The         applicant                  then\n\npreferred an application on 18.9.2006 for permitting him\n\nto       insert the verification clause without changing                                                                any\n\naverments                  in         the         affidavit                  of         evidence.

The\n\npetitioner                   had         also         preferred                   a        Civil             Revision\n\nApplication                  against              the        order             of       the         Metropolitan\n\nMagistrate                 which was dismissed by the Sessions Court as\n\nthe order impugned was interlocutory.\n\n3.

The           learned advocate then refers                                                     to         the\n\njudgment                   and          order of a learned Single Judge                                                          of         this\n\nCourt             in         the case of Suryakanta & Ors.                                                       v/s.

The           learned\n\nadvocate                   points out that under the Oaths Act, section 7\n\nprovides                   that an omission or irregularity of an oath or\n\naffirmation                        would not invalidate a proceeding or render\n\ninadmissible, evidence in respect of which such omission\n\nor irregularity has occurred.\n\n5.                   On         the other hand, the learned advocate for the\n\nrespondent                      relied                on the judgment of a learned                                                     Single\n\nJudge             of         this Court (A.D.

The           Supreme                 Court              in the case                        of         Associated\n\nJournals Limited was dealing with a Company Appeal filed\n\nfrom a Company Petition.                                              The Supreme Court held that if\n\nan        affidavit has some defect or irregularity, the                                                                                    same\n\ncan          be cured by giving an opportunity to the affiant to\n\nrectify                 the same.                     The Court observed that the Rules of\n\nProcedure                    cannot                be         a       tool            to         circumvent                      justice.\n\nTechnical pleas should not be allowed to defeat the ends\n\nof justice especially when raised after several years.\n\n7.                   In         the case of Suryakanta & Others (supra), the\n\nlearned                 Single               Judge (S.B.                         Deshmukh, J.) was                                  dealing\n\nwith            a matter under section 127 of the Cr.P.C.                                                                           It         was\n\nfound             that the application filed had not been signed by\n\nthe          petitioner for herself or on behalf of the                                                                             minors.\n\nThe          learned                 Judge              was           of         the          view            that             with            the\n\npermission of the Court it was permissible under Order 6\n\nRule            15         of        the           Civil Procedure                               Code            to         include                 a\n\nverification                         if it did not find place in the                                                           affidavit\n\nas originally filed.\n\n8.                   In         the          case of Nandakumar Mhatre (supra),                                                                the\n\nlearned                 Judge              has          opined                that               a       party              cannot               be\n\npermitted                    to amend the affidavit which has already been\n\nfiled             by         him as such an affidavit cannot                                                          be         amended.\n\nThe learned Judge has placed reliance on the decision of\n\nthe          Supreme                 Court in AKK Nambiar\u2019s case (supra).                                                                      The\n\n                                                                                                      :::   Downloaded on            - 13/02/2023 19:38:02           :::                                                        : 6 :\n\nSupreme               Court              has        observed                 that          in         essence                a\n\nverification                      is       required               to         enable            the         Court           to\n\ndetermine                whether             it would be safe to act on                                      such          an\n\naffidavit of evidence.                                The Court then discarded all the\n\naffidavits                 as they lacked a proper verification clause.\n\nHowever,              no application had been made for insertion                                                           of\n\nthe        verification in the affidavit, like in the                                                          present\n\ncase.\n\n9.                In       view of the decision of the Supreme Court in\n\nthe case of Associated Journals Limited (supra), I am of\n\nthe opinion that the application filed for including the\n\nverification                   clause             must be allowed.                         It is a             curable\n\ndefect            and the Court can permit the applicant to insert\n\nthe        verification                    clause in the affidavit of                                      evidence.\n\nUndoubtedly,                   the cross-examination of the applicant has\n\ncommenced.                     However,               no       objection                   was        raised               by\n\nRespondent                 No.2 at that stage prior to commencement                                                        of\n\ncross-examination.                             Apart from this, it would always be\n\nopen         for the applicant to lead oral evidence in support\n\nof       his        case.           When this is the position, I do not                                                 see\n\nany        reason            why         the applicant cannot be                                  permitted                to\n\ninsert            the        verification clause in order to prevent                                                       an\n\nabuse of the process of law.\n\n10.               The application is allowed.                                       The applicant shall\n\ninsert the verification clause in the affidavit filed by\n\n                                                                                      :::  Downloaded on        - 13/02/2023 19:38:02      :::                                                                   : 7 :\n\nhim          within                two          week from today.

BASANT, J.\n                      -----------------------------------------------\n                           Crl.M.C. No. 2418   OF 2008\n                      -----------------------------------------------\n                     Dated this the 30th day of June, 2008\n                                         O R D E R\n         The petitioner is the defacto complainant in a prosecution\nfor offences punishable under Sections 498, 323, 324 and 406(2)\nread with Section 34 IPC.  Cognizance in that case has been\ntaken on the basis of a final report submitted by police after due\ninvestigation.\n        2. While that prosecution was pending, the petitioner had\nfiled a complaint before the Magistrate complaining about the\ninadequacy of investigation and further alleging that in addition to\nthe offences referred above for which cognizance was taken in the\npolice charged case, the accused persons have committed\noffences punishable under Sections 379 and 341 IPC  also.\nCognizance appears to have been  taken by the learned\nMagistrate though the  sections of law for which cognizance has\nbeen taken is not very clear from the documents presently placed\nbefore me.  The Private complaint and the police charge case\nwere numbered as CC 1266/04(police charge case) and CCCrl.M.C. No. 2418 OF 2008\n                                                2\n\nNo.282/05(the private complaint).\n        3. The accused in these cases are common.  Substantially,\nthe witnesses are also common.  Accused 3 and 4 filed Crl.M.C\nNo.5400 of 2007 in the private complaint requesting that there\nmay be consolidation of charges and a common trial may be\nconducted.  The section of law quoted was Section 210 Cr.P.C.\nThe learned Magistrate after hearing both sides appears to have\nbeen passed Annexure A3 order under which joint trial has been\ndirected to be held in these two cases.\n        4. Petitioner/defacto complainant claims to be aggrieved by\nthe impugned order.  First of all it is contended that the learned\nMagistrate has not considered the crucial question whether \u201cthe\nprosecution version in the police case and the private complaint\ncase are materially different, contradictory and mutually exclusive\u201d.\nWithout and before deciding this crucial question, no consolidation\nof charges should have been directed under Section 223 Cr.P.C.\nThe learned counsel for the petitioner submits that Section 210\nCr.P.C       has     no     application        whatsoever          in    the     facts      and\ncircumstances of this case as the private complaint was filed longCrl.M.C. No. 2418 OF 2008\n                                                3\n\nafter the final report was filed and cognizance was taken on the\nbasis of the final report.\n        5. I find merit in the submissions of the learned counsel for\nthe petitioner.  I am satisfied that the learned Magistrate should\nnot have ordered consolidation of charges under Section 223\nCr.P.C in the private complaint and the police charge case.  This\nis absolutely clear in the light of the                       pronouncement of the\nSupreme Court in Harjinder Singh v. State of Punjab [1985 SC\n404], Mani v. Swaminathan [1986 KLT 170],  Peter v. Kurian\n[1994 (1) KLT 17] and Samuel Mathai V. State of Kerala [2007(3)\nKHC 682].  It is certainly not the law that merely because some\nfurther offences are alleged to have been committed, a separate\ntrial must be held in a private protest complaint.  The crucial\nquestion is whether the allegations raised in the two cases \u201care\nmaterially different, contradictory and mutually exclusive\u201d as to\njustify separate trial in the two cases.  If they are the procedure\nprescribed in         Mani v. Swaminathan(supra),                        will have to be\nfollowed.  If they are not, consolidation of charges is perfectlyCrl.M.C. No. 2418 OF 2008\n                                                4\n\njustified.\n        6. In as much as the learned Magistrate has not considered\nthis aspect in detail and there is nothing to indicate that mind has\nbeen applied by the learned Magistrate pointedly to this crucial\naspect.  I am of  opinion that the impugned order can be set aside\nand the learned Magistrate can be directed to consider the prayer\nfor consolidation, under Section 223 Cr.P.C (and not Section 210\nCr.P.C), afresh after giving the petitioner herein and the accused\npersons an opportunity to advance their respective contentions.\n        7. In the nature of the order which I propose to pass, I am\nsatisfied that it is not necessary to wait for issue and return of\nnotice to the accused/petitioner in Crl.M.C No.5400/07.\n        8. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the\ncase now stands posted to 01.07.08 with non bailable warrant\nissued against the witnesses.  I direct that warrant of arrest need\nnot be executed, if witnesses do appear before the learned\nMagistrate on 01.07.08 and undertake to appear before court on\nthe next date of posting to be fixed by the court, after disposal of\nCrl.M.C No.5400/07 afresh in accordance with law.Crl.M.C.

As  per  the  Bank,   the  accused  -  present                                       :2:\n\n              respondent  no.2  had issued cheque bearing  No.132136\n\n              dated  6/1/2004  drawn  on the Bank  of  Madura  Ltd.,\n\n              Chembur  Branch in the sum of Rs.1,20,00,000/- in  its\n\n              favour  and  the cheque was issued by the  accused  on\n\n              behalf of M/s.  N.N.  Weaving Mill but in his capacity\n\n              as  Proprietor.   When  the cheque was  submitted  for\n\n              encashment,   it  was  returned   as  dishonoured   on\n\n              20/1/2004.   A legal notice dated 13/2/2004 issued  to\n\n              and  received by the accused did not result in payment\n\n              of  the amount to the complainant and, therefore,  the\n\n              complaint  under  Section 138 of N.I.  Act came to  be\n\n              filed.   The  complainant stepped in the  witness  box\n\n              himself and so did the accused.  It was the defence of\n\n              the  accused  that  his firm was granted  cash  credit\n\n              facility  initially and subsequently it was  converted\n\n              into  the  term  loan  facility   of  120  months   on\n\n              24/4/2003.   As  per  the Bank, such  a  facility  was\n\n              granted  subject to the execution of documents by  the\n\n              accused  and  as  the accused failed  to  execute  the\n\n              documents, it remained as cash credit facility.\n\n              3.      Coming  to the subject cheque, the trial court\n\n              noted  the  defence  of the accused  namely  that  the                                       :3:\n\n              cheque  was  dated 18/12/2002, it could not have  been\n\n              submitted  for  encashment any time after  six  months\n\n              therefrom   and  the   complainant-bank  without   the\n\n              knowledge  of  the accused corrected the date  of  the\n\n              cheque as 6/1/2004 and submitted it for encashment for\n\n              which  he was not liable, more so when it was  without\n\n              his  knowledge  or permission.  The trial court  noted\n\n              that  the  cheque was signed by the accused  on  three\n\n              different  places but in the same ink and,  therefore,\n\n              it  drew a presumption that the accused put all  these\n\n              three  signatures on 18/12/2002 and for the correction\n\n              of  dated  to 6/1/2004 he had not signed.   The  trial\n\n              court  referred to the admissions given by PW 1 in his\n\n              cross-examination that the cheque was dated 18/12/2002\n\n              and  the  date was corrected subsequently to  6/1/2004\n\n              and  in  a  different ink by him.   The  trial  court,\n\n              therefore,  referred to the decision of the Kerla High\n\n              Court  in  the case of Ramchandran vs.   K.   Dineshan\n\n              [2005  ALL  MR (Cri) Journal 177] and the decision  of\n\n              this court in the case of Credential Finance Ltd.  vs.\n\n              State  of Maharashtra [2000 (3) Mh.L.J.  544] and held\n\n              that  the  subject cheque had lost its character as  a\n\n              negotiable  instrument after the expiry of six  months                                       :4:\n\n              from  18/12/2002.  This view taken by the trial  court\n\n              cannot be termed as perverse or illegal having regards\n\n              to   the  admissions  given  by   the  PW  1  in   his\n\n              cross-examination before the trial court.\n\n              4.      There  is no case made out that the  reasoning\n\n              set  out by the trial court in support of the order of\n\n              acquittal  requires  reconsideration at the  hands  of\n\n              this court.\n\n              5.      Hence,  leave  to  appeal is refused  and  the\n\n              application is rejected.\n\n                                              (B.H.  Marlapalle,J.)"

It was stated in the plaint that the Defendants informed the\n\n             husband of the Plaintiff that the property was mortgaged\n\n             with ICICI Home Finance Company Ltd and requested the\n\n             Plaintiff to take loan from the same very bank so that the\n\n             mortgaged amount can be adjusted and title deeds can be\n\n             obtained from the bank directly by the Plaintiff in order to\n\n             save the commission money.\n\n6.

The Plaintiff on 10th January 2005 purchased the stamp\n\n             paper of the value of Rs. 1,23,000/- which was the agreed\n\n             price of the suit property.\n\n8.           It is averred in the plaint that the Defendants were insisting\n\n             for some amount before execution of the sale deed so on\n\n             12th        January              2005           two         cheques               i.e      cheque             bearing\n\n             No.458946 dated 12th January 2005 for Rs. 11,25,000/- and\n\n             cheque bearing No.458947 dated 12th January 2005 for Rs.\n\n             2,50,000/- both drawn on Punjab National Bank, Ashok\n\n             Vihar, Delhi were given to Defendant No.1 being the part\n\n             payment                 against              the          total          sale          consideration                      of\n\n             Rs.27,75,000/-.                             The          Plaintiff              also          requested                 the\n\n             Defendants to give the necessary consent letter to ICICI\n\n             Home Finance Co.Ltd for facilitating the transfer of the\n\n             original            title       deed         documents.                      Defendants                 were          also\n\n             requested to execute the necessary agreement to sell as\n\n             required by the aforesaid bank but the Defendants did not\n\n             do the needful and attempted to avoid the same inspite of\n\n             the assurance given by the Defendants that the Defendants\n\n             would            clear        the       loan         taken          by      them          against            the       suit\n\n             property.\n\n9.           The case of the Plaintiff is that in view of the above the\n\n             Plaintiff became apprehensive about the conduct of the\n\n             Defendants as is evident from the fact that even after\n\n             adjusting              the      amount             of      Rs.       7,     36,000/-             taken          by      the\n\n    RFA (OS) No.16/2008                                                       Page 3 of 14\n             Plaintiff from the bank as advised by the Defendants, still\n\n             an        amount              of        Rs.13,14,000/-                      was          payable              by        the\n\n             Defendants to the bank because the loan amount due from\n\n             the Defendants was Rs. 20,50,000/-. The Plaintiff left with\n\n             no option sent a registered letter dated 14th January 2005 to\n\n             the Defendants to do the needful.  The husband of the\n\n             Plaintiff called the Defendant No.1 on 15th January 2005 in\n\n             order to remind the Defendants of their obligation but the\n\n             Defendants did not cooperate.  The Plaintiff also wrote a\n\n             letter dated 15th January 2005 to ICICI Home Finance Co.\n\n             Ltd informing that all the requirements of the bank had\n\n             been intimated to the Defendants and they were requested\n\n             to clear the entire loan amount so that the deal can be\n\n             completed within time and the bank was also requested to\n\n             disburse             the       loan        amount             sanctioned                in     favour           of      the\n\n             Plaintiff.\n\n10.          On 20th January 2005 the Plaintiff also prepared two pay\n\n             orders for a sum of Rs.13,25,000/- (pay order No.664711\n\n             dated 20th January 2005) and another for Rs.5,25,000/-\n\n             (pay          order          No.66710                 dated           20th        January             2005)            and\n\n             informed the Defendant No.1 about the preparation of the\n\n             two pay orders amounting to Rs.18,50,000/- in his name.\n\n             Defendants were informed of the stoppage of payment of\n\n             the earlier three cheques issued by the                                                       Plaintiff.  The\n\n             husband of the Plaintiff also contacted the property dealer\n\n    RFA (OS) No.16/2008                                                       Page 4 of 14\n             and the Home Finance Counseller of ICICI Home Finance\n\n             Co.Ltd and requested them to depute their representative at\n\n             the time of execution of the sale deed in favour of the\n\n             Plaintiff and the entire sale consideration was ready with\n\n             the Plaintiff on 20th January 2005.\n\n11.          Despite the above the Defendants did not turn up for\n\n             getting the necessary documents and presenting them for\n\n             registration of the sale deed in favour of the Plaintiff.  The\n\n             Defendant No.1 was also contacted on his Mobile No.\n\n             9810107101 by the husband of the Plaintiff in the morning\n\n             but nobody turned up till 1 PM.  When contacted second\n\n             time the Defendant No.1 gave the excuse that Defendant\n\n             No.2 was not feeling well since morning and, therefore,\n\n             requested for time.\n\n12.          A      legal notice dated                          17th       April         2005 was                 sent        to the\n\n             Defendants to execute and register the sale deed in favour\n\n             of the Plaintiff which was received back as undelivered.\n\n             Due to the said conduct of the Defendant and on the basis\n\n             of legal advise  a complaint dated 16th May 2005 was\n\n             lodged by the                      Plaintiff with the Police Station Rohini\n\n             against Defendant No.1 and his brother Sh. Atul Bansal as\n\n             the deal was settled in his presence.  The complaint against\n\n             Defendant No.2 was not lodged on humanitarian grounds\n\n             being an old lady of more than 62 years.\n\n    RFA (OS) No.16/2008                                                       Page 5 of 14\n13.          Instead            of       showing              his       readiness               and        willingness                 to\n\n             complete the transaction the Defendant No.1 as a counter\n\n             blast sent a legal notice dated 13th June 2005 alleging\n\n             therein           that       the       cheque            bearing             No.458943                  dated         19th\n\n             December 2004 for Rs. 2 lac as part payment (Bayana)\n\n             issued by the Plaintiff in favour of Defendant No.1 was\n\n             dishonoured and, therefore, the Plaintiff was guilty under\n\n             Section             420        IPC         and        Section             138        of      the       Negotiable\n\n             Instrument Act.  It is also a matter of fact that after sending\n\n             the said legal notice the cheque of Rs.2 lac was also\n\n             encashed by the Defendants.\n\n14.          In Para 22 of the plaint the Plaintiff has averred that\n\n             thereafter before the Sub Inspector Rohini Police Station,\n\n             Delhi, during the course of investigation the Defendant\n\n             No.1 agreed and admitted the facts stated and entered into\n\n             a      settlement-cum-agreement                                    dated           19th        October              2005\n\n             whereby it was agreed that the Defendants would execute\n\n             the        sale        deed         in      favour            of      the        Plaintiff,            subject            to\n\n             enhancing the sale consideration by Rs. 3 lac over and\n\n             above the amount of Rs.27,75,000/- which was the original\n\n             sale consideration and it was agreed between the parties\n\n             that the sale deed would be executed by the Defendants in\n\n             favour of the Plaintiff by the end of December 2005.\n\n15.          In view of the above said settlement-cum-agreement dated\n\n             19th October 2005 the Plaintiff again applied for loan from\n\n    RFA (OS) No.16/2008                                                       Page 6 of 14\n             ICICI Home Finance Co. Ltd in the last week of October\n\n             2005 and an amount of Rs.8,13,000/- was sanctioned in her\n\n             favour on 6th November 2005.  However, the Defendants\n\n             again avoided the execution and registration of the sale\n\n             deed of the suit property through from 19th October 2005\n\n             till February 2006 the Defendant No.1 was in regular touch\n\n             with the husband of Plaintiff via SMS on his Mobile No.\n\n             9312214189 and Defendant No.\u2019s Mobile No.9810107101.\n\n             The details of the SMS were also given in Para 24 of the\n\n             plaint.\n\n16.          A registered legal notice dated 20th February 2006 was sent\n\n             to the Defendants for performance of the agreement but the\n\n             Defendants                  never          took        any        step        in     furtherance                of      the\n\n             agreement.  The Plaintiff thus filed the suit for specific\n\n             performance of the agreement to sell regarding the suit\n\n             property.\n\n17.          That thereafter the Defendants filed an application under\n\n             Order 7 Rule 11 read with Section 151 CPC on many\n\n             grounds for rejection of the suit of the Plaintiff mainly on\n\n             the ground that the suit is absolutely barred by law as the\n\n             agreement itself provides for liquidated damages, if any,\n\n             that the suit was also bad on account of non-payment of\n\n             stamp duty and registration of the impugned agreement.\n\n             Another ground was taken by the Defendant that the plaint\n\n             has no cause of action as the payment of Bayana amount\n\n    RFA (OS) No.16/2008                                                       Page 7 of 14\n             itself        was         stopped             by      the       Plaintiff            and        thereafter              the\n\n             payment of the cheque issued towards the part payment\n\n             was also stopped.  Therefore, there was no concluded\n\n             contract between the parties and no cause of action arose in\n\n             favour of the Plaintiff.  It was further alleged that the\n\n             second document i.e. agreement-cum-settlement dated 19th\n\n             October 2005 executed in the Police Station was under\n\n             coercion, undue influence and duress and prayer was made\n\n             for rejection of the plaint.\n\n18.          Learned Single Judge while allowing the application of the\n\n             Defendants under Order VII Rule 11 CPC rejected the\n\n             plaint of the Plaintiff and observed that the Plaintiff\u2019s\n\n             plaint failed to disclose any cause of action against the\n\n             Defendant to seek the relief of specific performance of the\n\n             agreement to sell dated 19th December, 2004 as novated /\n\n             modified on 19th October 2005.  It was observed that \u201cit is\n\n             evident from the pleadings in the plaint and the Plaintiff\u2019s\n\n             documents that the Plaintiff was made aware upfront that\n\n             the        suit       property              was          mortgaged                 with          ICICI            Home\n\n             Finance.  Order VI Rule 6 provides and reads as follows:\n\n                       \u201cR.6.Condition                      precedent                \u2013     Any         condition\n                       precedent, the performance or occurrence of\n                       which is intended to be contested, shall be\n                       distinctly specified in his pleadings by the\n                       plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be;\n                       and,         subject            thereto,            an       averment                of      the\n                       performance or occurrence of all conditions\n                       precedent                necessary                for       the        case         of       the\n\n    RFA (OS) No.16/2008                                                       Page 8 of 14\n                       plaintiff or defendant shall be implied in his\n                       pleadings.\u201d\n\n                                        Since            the       Plaintiff             had         not        pleaded              the\n\n             condition and its non performance, it would imply failure\n\n             to disclose cause of action.  The Plaintiff failed to show her\n\n             readiness and willingness to fulfill her own obligations\n\n             under the agreement to complete the sale transaction and\n\n             there was no reasonable and acceptable approach on the\n\n             part of the Plaintiff.\n\n19.          The Plaintiff thereafter filed an application under Order 47\n\n             Rule 1 read with Section 151 CPC for reviewing/recalling\n\n             of the order dated 19th July 2007.  The said application was\n\n             also dismissed by the learned single Judge vide order dated\n\n             6th November 2007.\n\n20.          After the dismissal of the review petition on 6th November\n\n             2007 the Plaintiff has filed the present appeal on various\n\n             grounds.\n\n21.          We have considered the submission and have also gone\n\n             through the material on record including the documents.\n\n22.           It is well settled law that rejection of the plaint is a serious\n\n             matter as it takes away the very basis of the suit rendering\n\n             as if there was no suit at all or that no suit was instituted.\n\n             Bare allegations made in the plaint and documents filed\n\n             therewith              are       required             to     be      looked            into       to     determine\n\n             whether the plaint discloses the cause of action.  In the suit\n\n    RFA (OS) No.16/2008                                                       Page 9 of 14\n             for specific performance of the contract if the facts averred\n\n             in the plaint clearly show that the Plaintiff had performed\n\n             all essential terms of contract, mere failure on his or her\n\n             part to reproduce the exact words of Statute is not fatal.\n\n             Only when the entire plaint does not disclose any cause of\n\n             action the plaint is liable to be rejected.\n\n23.          It is also well settled law that the pleas taken by the\n\n             defendants                 in     the       written            statement              would            be       wholly\n\n             irrelevant at that stage. The correctness of allegations made\n\n             in the plaint or otherwise is not to be considered at the\n\n             stage of  consideration of question as to whether the plaint\n\n             is liable to be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 on the\n\n             ground that it does not disclose cause of action.  The power\n\n             to reject a plaint under this clause must be exercised only if\n\n             the court comes to the conclusion that even if at all the\n\n             allegations are proved the Plaintiff would not be entitled to\n\n             any relief whatever.  So long as the plaint discloses some\n\n             cause of action or raises some question fit to be decided by\n\n             the Court, mere fact that the case is weak and not likely to\n\n             succeed is no ground for striking it out.\n\n24.          In Mayar (H.K.) Ltd vs. Owners & Parties, Vessel M.V.\n\n             Fortune              Express              (2006          AIR          (SC)         1828),           Apex          Court\n\n             observed that:\n\n                  \u201cIt is apparent that the plaint cannot be rejected on\n                  the basis of the allegations made by the defendant in\n                  his       written            statement                or      in      an       application                 for\n\n   RFA (OS) No.16/2008                                                       Page 10 of 14\n           rejection of the plaint.  The court has to read the\n           entire plaint as a whole to find out whether it\n           discloses a cause of action and if it does, then the\n           plaint cannot be rejected by the Court exercising the\n           powers under Order VII, Rule 11 of the Code.\n           Essentially, whether the plaint discloses a cause of\n           action, is a question of fact which has to be gathered\n           on the basis of the averments made in the plaint in\n           its entirety taking those averments to be correct.  A\n           cause of action is a bundle of facts which are\n           required to be proved for obtaining relief and for\n           said purpose, the material facts are required to be\n           stated but not the evidence except in certain cases\n           where the pleadings relied on are in regard to\n           misrepresentation, fraud, willful default, undue\n           influence or of the same nature.  So long as the\n           plaint discloses some cause of action which requires\n           determination by the court, mere fact that in the\n           opinion of the Judge the plaintiff may not succeed\n           cannot be a ground for rejection of the plaint.\u201d\n\n25.     In Vijai Pratap Singh vs. Dukh Haran Nath Singh (AIR\n\n        1962 SC 941) the Supreme Court held as under (AIR\n\n        pp.943-44, para 9):\n\n           \u201cthe court has not to see whether the claim made by\n           the petitioner is likely to succeed; it has merely to\n           satisfy itself that the allegations made in the petition,\n           if accepted as true, would entitle the petitioner to the\n           relief he claims. If accepting those allegations as true\n           no case is made out or granting relief no cause of\n           action would be shown and the petition must be\n           rejected.  But in ascertaining whether the petition\n           shows a cause of action the court does not enter upon\n           a trial of the issues affecting the merits of the claim\n           made      by    the    petitioner.     It   cannot     take     into\n           consideration the defences which the defendant may\n           raise upon the merits; nor has the court competent to\n           make      and    elaborate      enquiry     into    doubtful      or\n           complicated questions of law or fact.\u201d\n\n26.             In Popat and Kotecha Property vs. State Bank of\n\n        India Staff Assocaition the Supreme Court held as under\n\n        (2005(7) Scale, page 3 para 10):\n\n  RFA (OS) No.16/2008                                                       Page 11 of 14\n                  \u201c10.                  Clause (d) of Order VII Rule 7 speaks of\n                  suit, as appears from the statement in the plaint to be\n                  barred by any law.  Disputed questions cannot be\n                  decided at the time of considering an application\n                  filed under Order VII Rule 11 CPC.  Clause (d) of\n                  Rule 11 of Order VII applies in those cases only\n                  where the statement made by the plaintiff in the\n                  plaint, without any doubt or dispute shows that the\n                  suit is barred by any law in force.\u201d\n\n\n27.          We         have         carefully             gone          through             the      impugned                 order,\n\n             pleadings and documents.  It appears from the plaint and\n\n             documents                  that        Defendant                 No.1           has        not        denied            the\n\n             execution                 of        the        receipt-cum-agreement                                  dated           19th\n\n             December, 2004.  The Defendant No.1 has also admitted\n\n             the total sale consideration of the property and also having\n\n             received Rs.4 lac as bayana.  The Defendant has not denied\n\n             that the property in question was mortgaged with ICICI\n\n             Home Finance Co. Ltd.  and required the Plaintiff to take\n\n             loan from the bank.  The Defendant No.1 has not denied\n\n             the fact that  the Plaintiff had applied for loan with some\n\n             other bank on 26th December, 2005 i.e. within one week of\n\n             the date of receipt-cum-agreement as well as sanctioning\n\n             of  the loan.  It is also a matter of fact that part bayana\n\n             amount of Rs.2 lac which was given to the Defendant by\n\n             the Plaintiff by way of cheque was subsequently  got\n\n             encashed by the                         Defendants.  It is not denied by the\n\n             Defendants that the Plaintiff prepared two pay orders for a\n\n             sum of Rs.13,25,000/- (pay order No.664711 dated 20th\n\n   RFA (OS) No.16/2008                                                       Page 12 of 14\n             January,              2005)            and         another             for       Rs.5,25,000/-),                     total\n\n             amounting to Rs.18,50,000/- in the name of Defendant\n\n             No.1.\n\n                           The Defendant has not disputed the execution of\n\n             another              document                 i.e.       settlement-cum-sale                            agreement\n\n             dated 19th October, 2005 which was executed between the\n\n             husband of the Plaintiff and Defendant No.1 in which\n\n             it     was        agreed            by      the       Defendant                 No.1         that        he      would\n\n             execute  a  sale  deed  in  favour of the Plaintiff subject to\n\n             enhancement of sale consideration of Rs.3 lac over and\n\n             above the amount of Rs.27,75,000/-which was the original\n\n             sale consideration. Although, the plea of the Defendant\n\n             No.1          that        the      agreement                 as      novated/modified                         on      19th\n\n             October,2005 was executed under the undue influence,\n\n             coercion or duress on the complaint filed by the Plaintiff\n\n             against           the       Defendant                in      the       police          station          cannot           be\n\n             determined at this stage and  particularly in the application\n\n             filed by the Defendant under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC\n\n             when the disputed questions are involved in the matter.\n\n28.          That in view of the abovesaid facts and well settled law,\n\n             we feel that the plaint prima facie discloses cause of action\n\n             and there are trial issues which require trial of the suit.\n\n             Further, at this stage the court is not deciding the matter on\n\n             merit of the case and we are unable to agree with the\n\n             finding of the learned single Judge about rejection of the\n\n   RFA (OS) No.16/2008                                                       Page 13 of 14\n             plaint for non-disclosure of cause of action. The Appeal is,\n\n             therefore, allowed and the impugned order dated 19th July\n\n             2007 challenged under appeal is set aside.  In view of this\n\n             the application of defendant under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC is\n\n             therefore                dismissed.

No.1343/2003 on\nthe file of the J.F.C.M.-I, Kottayam challenges  the conviction  entered\nand the sentence passed against  him for an offence punishable under\nSec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to\nas 'the Act').\n        2.      I heard the learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner and\nthe learned Public Prosecutor.\n        3.      The learned counsel appearing for the Revision Petitioner\nre-iterated the contentions in support of the Revision.  The courts below\nhave concurrently held that the cheque in question was drawn by the\nrevision petitioner in favour of the  complainant on the drawee bank, that\nthe cheque was validly presented to the bank, that it was dishonoured\nfor reasons which fall under Section 138 of the Act, that the\ncomplainant made a demand for payment by a notice in time in\naccordance with clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 of the Act  and\nthat the Revision Petitioner/accused failed to make the payment  within\n15 days of receipt of the statutory notice.                       Both the courts have\nconsidered and rejected the defence set up by the revision petitioner\nwhile  entering the above finding.   The said finding has been recordedCrl.R.P.No.3094/07\n                                              : 2 :\n\non an appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence.  I do  not find\nany error, illegality or impropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently\nby the courts below.  The conviction was thus rightly entered against\nthe  petitioner.\n        4.      What now survives for consideration is the question as to\nwhether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision\nPetitioner.  I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on\nthe revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition\nhereinafter mentioned.  Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the\n2nd respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357\n(3) Cr.P.C. a sum of Rs.60,000/- (Rupees sixty thousand only) within\nfour months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till\nthe rising of the court.  If on the other hand, the revision petitioner\ncommits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo\nsimple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence.\nMoney, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if\nany, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the\nrevision petitioner.\n        This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but\nmodifying the sentence as above.\n\n                                                             (V.

Heard  Mr.Waghmare the learned counsel for the  for\n\n              the  Applicant.   Perused  the   copy  of  the  impugned\n\n              judgment.\n\n              2.       The  applicant, who is original complainant has\n\n              filed  this  application seeking leave to prefer  appeal\n\n              against  the order of acquittal passed by the  J.M.F.C.,\n\n              2nd  Court,  Malegaon,  on  20th May,  2005  in  Summary\n\n              Criminal  Case  No.602 of 2003 under Section 138 of  the\n\n              Negotiable Instruments Act.  According to the applicant,\n\n              the  accused/respondent had purchased certain goods from\n\n              the  applicant and had issued two cheques dated 8-8-2002\n\n              and 14-8-2002.  The applicant deposited the said cheques\n\n              on  21-1-2003 for encashment.  However, the cheques were\n\n              dishonoured on the ground of \u2019insufficient funds\u2019 in the                                : 2 :\n\n              account  of  the  accused.   During  the  trial  it  was\n\n              revealed  that  one  Pradip  Hukumchand  Pahade  is  the\n\n              proprietor  of  H.P.Traders.  The cheque was signed  and\n\n              issued   by  the  said   Pradip  Pahade.   However,  the\n\n              complaint   was  filed  against   his  brother   Subhash\n\n              Hukumchand Pahade as the proprietor of H.P.Traders.  The\n\n              trial Court came to a conclusion that Subhash is not the\n\n              proprietor nor he had issued the cheques.  Therefore, he\n\n              could  not  be held guilty for the  offences  punishable\n\n              under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.\n\n              3.       Taking   into  consideration   the  facts   and\n\n              circumstances  of  the  case,  it   is  clear  that  the\n\n              applicant  had prosecuted a wrong person.  Therefore,  I\n\n              find no fault with the impugned order of acquittal.\n\n              4.       Leave refused.  Application stands rejected.\n\n                                    (J.H.Bhatia,J.)"

His absence was not wilful;\n\nbut was on account of reasons beyond his control.\n\n           2.         According to the petitioner, he is absolutely innocent.\n\nThe petitioner is willing to pay the cheque amount to the\n\ncomplainant                    along            with           reasonable                  interest.                    But          the\n\ncomplainant, in his anxiety to vex and harass the petitioner, is\n\nnot willing to compound the case.  The matter hence drags on\n\nunnecessarily.                    The petitioner now wants to surrender before\n\nthe        learned             Magistrate                  and         seek          regular             bail.             But        heCrl.M.C.No.2791/07                                2\n\napprehends that his application for regular bail may not be\n\nconsidered by the learned Magistrate on merits, in accordance\n\nwith law and expeditiously.   He, therefore, prays that directions\n\nunder Section 438 and/or 482 Cr.P.C. may be issued to the\n\nlearned Magistrate to release the petitioner on bail when he\n\nappears and applies for bail.\n\n        3.      The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that to\n\nshow his bonafides, the petitioner shall deposit the cheque\n\namount with interest before the learned Magistrate within a\n\nperiod of fifteen days.\n\n        4.      Having considered all the relevant inputs, I am\n\npersuaded to agree that directions under Section 438/482 Cr.P.C\n\ncan be issued in favour of the petitioner.  I am impressed by the\n\noffer made by the learned counsel for the petitioner to deposit an\n\namount of Rs.45,000/- before the learned Magistrate to show his\n\nbona fides.\n\n        5.      This petition is, in these circumstances, allowed.\n\nFollowing directions are issued under Section 438/482 Cr.P.C.\n\n        i)      The petitioner shall surrender before the learned\n\nMagistrate at 11 a.m on 22/9/2007.  Till then the non-bailable\n\nwarrant issued against him shall not be executed.Crl.M.C.No.2791/07                                3\n\n        ii)     He shall be released on regular bail on condition that\n\nhe deposits an amount of Rs.45,000/- (Rupees forty five thousand\n\nonly) and executes a bond for Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty five\n\nthousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to\n\nthe satisfaction of the learned Magistrate.\n\n        6.      The learned Magistrate shall record the plea of the\n\naccused on the date of surrender and shall thereafter permit him\n\nto be represented by his counsel.  Subsequent personal presence\n\nof the petitioner shall be insisted only if it is absolutely necessary\n\nfor the further progress of the case.  I record the submission of\n\nthe learned counsel for the petitioner that if the complainant is\n\nwilling to accept the said amount and compound the same, the\n\nentire amount can be released to the complainant forthwith.\n\n        Hand over copy of this order to the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner.\n\n\n\n                                                          (R.BASANT, JUDGE)\n\njsrCrl.M.C.No.2791/07                                4Crl.M.C.No.2791/07                                5              R.BASANT, J.\n\n                 CRL.M.CNo.\n\n                        ORDER\n\n21ST DAY OF MAY2007"

(ORAL)\n\nCrl.M.A. No. 5016/2018\n\n           For the reasons stated in the application, delay of 381 days in re-filing\n\nthe petition is condoned.\n\n           Application is disposed of.\n\nCrl.M.A. No. 5015/2018 and Crl.M.A. No. 31920/2018\n\n1.         By       these       applications,             the      petitioner           seeks        to    place        on      record\n\nadditional document.  Additional document sought to be placed is the receipt\n\nof loan amount.  Though in oral arguments petitioner claims that the receipt\n\nwas lost, however, no such averment has been made in the application.  The\n\nreceipt being in possession of the petitioner, it is not the case where the\n\nCRL.L.P. 171/2016                                                                                                         Page 1 of 4\npetitioner was not in possession of this evidence during the course of trial.\n\nPermission to lead additional evidence for documents which were already in\n\npossession to fill up the lacunae in the prosecution case is not permissible.\n\nFurther what can be permitted in an appeal is leading of additional evidence\n\nthat too sparingly on the evidence which was not available to the parties\n\nduring the course of trial and not merely placing on record documents.\n\n2.      Applications are dismissed.\n\n3.      Petitioner has now placed on record original cash receipt, at page 54\n\nof the present petition as Annexure- P/9, which the Registry is directed to\n\nreturn to the petitioner by keeping the registered copy thereof on record.\n\nCRL.L.P. 171/2016\n\n1.      The present leave to appeal petition is directed against the impugned\njudgment dated 19th December, 2015 passed by the Learned Metropolitan\n\nMagistrate acquitting the respondent in CC No. 1406/15 titled as 'Ankur\n\nGupta v. Braj Mohan Pandey', whereby the complaint preferred by the\n\npetitioner under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (in\n\nshort 'NI Act') was dismissed and the respondent/accused was acquitted.\n\n2.      Brief exposition of facts as per the complaint is that the petitioner was\n\nengaged in the business of sale and purchase of computer parts/equipment.\n\nRespondent was known to the petitioner and they had good relations.\n\nRespondent approached the petitioner for a personal loan as he was in dire\n\nneed of money due to financial crunch. Petitioner gave the loan to the\n\nrespondent on the assurance of the respondent having given a post dated\ncheque     bearing     number      062946      dated    1st  March,      2015    for   a   sum    of\n\n\u20b95,00,000/- drawn on Axis bank, East of Kailash, New Delhi and that the\n\nCRL.L.P. 171/2016                                                                       Page 2 of 4\ncheque would be honoured when presented.  When the cheque was\npresented for encashment on 9th March, 2015, it was returned unpaid vide\nmemo dated 17th March, 2015 with remarks 'funds insufficient'. Thereafter,\npetitioner sent legal notice dated 26th March, 2006 through registered post\n\nand courier.  Despite notice having been served, respondent failed to make\n\nthe payment within statutory period.  Hence, the complaint.\n\n3.         Notice under Section 251 Cr.P.C. was framed against the respondent\n\nto which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.\n\n4.         To substantiate the case, petitioner examined himself as CW-1 and\n\nadduced his evidence by way of an affidavit and proved original cheque vide\n\nEx.CW-1/A, returning memo vide Ex.CW-1/B, legal notice and registered\n\npost      receipts        and       courier        receipts         vide      Ex.CW-1/C                to    Ex.CW-1/L               and\n\noriginal complaint vide Ex.CW-1/M.\n\n5.         In     the     statement           of     the     respondent             recorded           under        Section          313\n\nCr.P.C., he denied having taken loan from the petitioner and also denied the\n\nreceipt of any legal notice.\n\n6.         A perusal of the evidence on record shows that the petitioner failed to\n\ndisclose the date and the amount of the alleged loan given by him to the\n\nrespondent. He also failed to produce any document on record to prove the\n\nfactum of advancement of alleged loan. Further, the petitioner admitted in\n\nhis cross-examination that he had not shown the loan amount in the Income\n\nTax Return. Thus, the petitioner failed to prove that there was a legally\n\nrecoverable debt payable by the respondent.\n\n7.         Finding of the learned Metropolitan Magistrate based on the evidence\n\non record is a plausible view.

Leave granted.\n\n2.      Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a learned Single Judge\nof the Karnataka High Court dismissing the petition filed under Section 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the \u2018Code\u2019).  Prayer in the\npetition was to quash all proceedings in CC No. 1042 of 2004 on the file of\nlearned Vth JMF Court Mangalore.  Appellant is the accused in the\naforesaid case in relation to an offence punishable under Section 138 of the\nNegotiable Instruments Act, 1881(in short the \u2018Act\u2019).  The petition was filed\nbefore the High Court on the ground that the Mangalore Court has no\njurisdiction to try the case.  It was stated that the agreement between the\nparties was entered into Bangalore and the parties live in Mangalore and the\ncheque were returned from the banks at Bangalore and therefore the\nBangalore Court has jurisdiction to try the case.\n\n3.      In response, the respondent had submitted that before issuing notice\nto the appellant he had shifted his residence to Mangalore and therefore he\nhad issued the notice from Mangalore which was received by the appellant\nand the reply was sent by her to the complainant to the Mangalore address.\nTherefore, as one of the components of the said offence i.e. notice in writing\nto the drawer of the cheque demanding payment of cheque amount was sent\nfrom Mangalore, Court at Mangalore had jurisdiction to try the case. The\nHigh Court noted that one of the components of the offence was giving\nnotice in writing to the drawer of the cheque demanding payment of the\n\n                                              2cheque amount.  The said action took place within Mangalore jurisdiction\nand, therefore, the petition was without merit.  It was however stated that if\nthe presence of the appellant was not very necessary for continuation of the\nproceeding, on appropriate application being filed, the court can grant\nexemption from appearance.\n\n4.      In support of the appeal learned counsel for the appellant submitted\nthat the Court at Mangalore had no jurisdiction.\n\n5.      Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand supported the\njudgment of the High Court.\n\n6.      In K. Bhaskaran v. Sankaran Vaidhyan Balan & Anr. [1999(7) SCC\n510],  it was inter alia observed as follows:\n\n                \u201c15. It is not necessary that all the above five acts should\n                have been perpetrated at the same locality. It is possible\n                that each of those five acts could be done at five different\n                localities. But a concatenation of all the above five is a\n                sine qua non for the completion of the offence under\n                Section 138 of the Code. In this context a reference to\n                Section 178(d) of the Code is useful. It is extracted\n                below:\n                    \u201c178.

Thus it is clear, if the five different acts were done\n                in five different localities any one of the courts\n                exercising jurisdiction in one of the five local areas can\n                become the place of trial for the offence under Section\n                138 of the Act. In other words, the complainant can\n                choose any one of those courts having jurisdiction over\n                any one of the local areas within the territorial limits of\n                which any one of those five acts was done. As the\n                amplitude stands so widened and so expansive it is an\n                idle exercise to raise jurisdictional question regarding the\n                offence under Section 138 of the Act.\n\n                    17. The more important point to be decided in this\n                case is whether the cause of action has arisen at all as the\n                notice sent by the complainant to the accused was\n                returned as \u201cunclaimed\u201d. The conditions pertaining to\n                the notice to be given to the drawer, have been\n                formulated and incorporated in clauses (b) to (c) of the\n                proviso to Section 138 of the Act. The said clauses are\n                extracted below:\n                    \u201c(b) the payee or the holder in due course of the\n                cheque, as the case may be, makes a demand for the\n                payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice\n                in writing, to the drawer of the cheque, within fifteen\n                days of the receipt of information by him from the bank\n                regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid; and\n                    (c) the drawer of such cheque fails to make the\n                payment of the said amount of money to the payee or as\n                the case may be, to the holder in due course of the\n                cheque within fifteen days of the receipt of the said\n                notice.\u201d\n\n7.      As was noted in K. Bhaskar\u2019s case (supra) the offence under Section\n138 of the Act can be completed only with the concatenation of a number of\nacts.  The acts which are components are as follows:\n\n                (1)   Drawing of the cheque;\n                (2)     Presentation of the cheque to the bank;\n                (3)     Returning the cheque unpaid by the drawee bank;\n\n                                              4                (4)     Giving notice in writing to the drawer of the cheque\n                        demanding payment of the cheque amount;\n                (5)     failure of the drawer to make payment within 15 days of\n                        the receipt of the notice.\n\n8.      It is not necessary that the above five acts should have been\nperpetrated at the same locality.  It is possible that each of those five acts\ncould be done at five different localities.  But concatenation of all the above\nfive is sine qua non for the completion of the offence under Section 138 of\nthe Act.\n\n9.      In view of the aforesaid, the judgment of the High Court does not\nsuffer from any infirmity to warrant interference.\n\n10.     The appeal is dismissed.\n\n                                         \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J.\n                                         (Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT)\n\n                                         \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026J.\n                                         (Dr. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA)\n\nNew Delhi:\nNovember 3, 2008\n\n                                              56"

On 19.03.2014, eleven criminal complaints were filed in the\n\ncourt of the Metropolitan Magistrate, each seeking prosecution of the\n\nparties shown in the array of respondents for offences punishable\n\nunder Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, two of\n\nsuch complaints i.e. the complaint nos.800/1/14 and 802/1/14 having\n\nbeen        presented             by      Jwala         Devi         Enterprises              Pvt.       Ltd.       through            its\n\nauthorized representative Sat Parkash Bansal and the rest \u2013 complaint\n\nnos.799/1/14,                 812/1/14,              813/1/14,             814/1/14,              815/1/14,              839/1/14,\n\n840/1/14, 841/1/14 and 842/1/14 \u2013 having been presented  by Anand\n\nPrakash Bansal, Proprietor of M/s. Pooja Enterprises.  Each of the said\n\ncriminal complaints were directed against several persons including a\n\ncompany described as M/s. Bush Foods Overseas Pvt. Ltd.  It may be\n\nmentioned that Mr. Virkaran Awasty was reflected in the array of the\n\naccused as the Managing Director of the said company accused.  The\n\nrespondents in these petitions were amongst the other persons shown\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.                                                                                         Page 10 of 24\n\n\n\n\nas accused in the said complaints, each of them having been described\n\nas \u201cDirector\u201d of the said company accused.\n\n2.          On       the      basis        of     the      preliminary               inquiry          in     each        case,       the\n\nMetropolitan                  Magistrate               issued           process             including              against           the\n\nrespondents herein.  The respondents, feeling aggrieved, approached\n\nthe court of Sessions invoking its revisional jurisdiction by separate\n\npetitions (CR nos.34-62/2015),  their prime contention being that there\n\nwas no case made out for they to be summoned as accused on the\n\nbasis of allegations that they were directors of the company accused,\n\ndenying that they had any concern with the responsibility for the\n\nconduct of the day-to-day business of the company.\n\n3.          Placing reliance primarily on decision of a bench of three\n\nHon\u2019ble Judges of the Supreme Court in SMS Pharmaceuticals Pvt.\n\nLtd. Vs. Neeta Bhalla, (2005) 8 SCC 89, the court of Sessions found\n\nsubstance and merit in the aforesaid contentions and allowed all the\n\nabove-said revision petitions by a common order dated 18.04.2015\n\nholding that the summoning order had been passed by the Magistrate\n\nmechanically without going through the material(s) on record, there\n\nbeing no averment to the effect that the said persons were in charge of,\n\nor responsible for the conduct of the business of, the company accused\n\nand consequently dropping the criminal proceedings against each of\n\nthem.\n\n4.          The petitions at hand have been filed by the complainants\n\ninvoking the inherent jurisdiction of this court under Section 482 of\n\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr. PC) and Article 227 of the\n\nConstitution of India, 1950 to pray for the aforesaid orders of the\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.                                                                                         Page 11 of 24\n\n\n\n\nSessions court in each of the said eleven complaint cases to be set\n\naside and the proceedings against the respondents herein to be revived\n\non the file of the Metropolitan Magistrate.  Reliance is placed in this\n\ncontext by the petitioners on the decisions of benches of two Hon\u2019ble\n\nJudges of the Supreme Court reported as Gunmala Sales (P) Ltd. Vs.\n\nAnu Mehta and Ors, (2015) 1 SCC 103 and Standard Chartered Bank\n\nVs. State of Maharashtra and Ors., (2016) 6 SCC 62.  There can be no\n\nquarrel with the proposition, as advanced by the counsel for the\n\nrespondents, that the ruling of the bench of three Hon\u2019ble Judges in\n\nSMS         Pharmaceuticals                      (supra),           continues             to      hold        the       field,       the\n\ndecisions in Gunmala Sales (P) Ltd. (supra) and Standard Chartered\n\nBank (supra) having accepted this position and the said subsequent\n\nrulings being in a slightly different context.\n\n5.          These matters pertain to the penal clause contained in Section\n\n138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, which reads thus :-\n\n              138. Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds\n              in the account \u2014 Where any cheque drawn by a person\n              on an account                     maintained               by     him       with        a    banker for\n              payment of any amount of money to another person from\n              out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in part,\n              of any debt or other liability, is returned by the bank\n              unpaid, either because of the amount of money standing to\n              the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the\n              cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid\n              from that account by an agreement made with that bank,\n              such        person           shall       be      deemed            to     have         committed              an\n              offence           and         shall,        without            prejudice              to      any        other\n              provision of this Act, be punished with imprisonment for 8\n              [a term which may be extended to two years\u2019], or with\n              fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque,\n              or with both:\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.                                                                                         Page 12 of 24\n\n\n\n\n         Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply\n         unless\u2014\n\n          (a) the cheque has been presented to the bank within a\n         period of six months from the date on which it is drawn or\n         within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier;\n\n         (b) the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as\n         the case may be, makes a demand for the payment of the\n         said amount of money by giving a notice; in writing, to the\n         drawer of the cheque,  within thirty days of the receipt of\n         information by him from the bank regarding the return of\n         the cheque as unpaid; and\n\n         (c) the drawer of such cheque fails to make the payment of\n         the said amount of money to the payee or, as the case may\n         be, to the holder in due course of the cheque, within\n         fifteen days of the receipt of the said notice.\n\n         Explanation.\u2014For the purposes of this section, \u201cdebt of\n         other liability\u201d means a legally enforceable debt or other\n         liability.\n\n6.      It is clear from the plain reading of the above quoted provision\n\nand is now also well settled that the offence under Section 138 of the\n\nNegotiable Instruments Act does not stand constituted merely upon\n\ndishonor of a cheque.  The dishonor of a cheque which had been\n\nissued by the person (who is sought to be prosecuted) in favour of the\n\ncomplainant must be followed by a notice of demand within the\n\nstipulated period.  It is the non-payment of the amount of the cheque\n\nwithin the statutory period after service of the notice of demand which\n\nconstitutes the offence that is punishable under the aforementioned\n\nprovision of law.\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.

It is the above quoted provision, which is at the bottom of the\n\ncontroversy in the present matters and in this context the rulings of the\n\nSupreme Court referred to above provide the necessary guidance.\n\n9.      Certain observations in SMS Pharmaceuticals (supra) which\n\nhave been quoted in the subsequent decisions, need to be borne in\n\nmind and, therefore, may be extracted as under :-\n\n                 \u201c10. \u2026 What is required is that the persons who are\n                 sought to be made criminally liable under Section 141\n                 should be, at the time the offence was committed, in\n                 charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct\n                 of the business of the company. Every person connected\n                 with the company shall not fall within the ambit of the\n                 provision. It is only those persons who were in charge of\n                 and    responsible      for   the   conduct      of   business     of   the\n                 company at the time of commission of an offence, who\n                 will be liable for criminal action. It follows from this that\n                 if a Director of a company who was not in charge of and\n                 was not responsible for the conduct of the business of the\n                 company at the relevant time, will not be liable under the\n                 provision. The liability arises from being in charge of\n                 and    responsible      for   the   conduct      of   business     of   the\n                 company      at   the   relevant     time   when     the   offence     was\n                 committed and not on the basis of merely holding a\n                 designation or office in a company. Conversely, a person\n                 not holding any office or designation in a company may\n                 be liable if he satisfies the main requirement of being in\n                 charge of and responsible for the conduct of business of a\n                 company at the relevant time. Liability depends on the\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.                                                   Page 15 of 24\n\n\n\n\n                 role one plays in the affairs of a company and not on\n                 designation or status. If being a Director or Manager or\n                 Secretary was enough to cast criminal liability, the\n                 section would have said so. Instead of \u201cevery person\u201d the\n                 section would have said \u201cevery Director, Manager or\n                 Secretary in a company is liable\u201d, etc. The legislature is\n                 aware that it is a case of criminal liability which means\n                 serious consequences so far as the person sought to be\n                 made liable is concerned.  Therefore, only persons who\n                 can be said to be connected with the commission of a\n                 crime at the relevant time have been subjected to action.\n\n                                 x x x\n\n        \u201c19. In view of the above discussion, our answers to the\n        questions posed in the reference are as under:\n\n         (a) It is necessary to specifically aver in a complaint under\n        Section 141 that at the time the offence was committed, the\n        person accused was in charge of, and responsible for the\n        conduct of business of the company. This averment is an\n        essential requirement of Section 141 and has to be made in\n        a complaint. Without this averment being made in a\n        complaint, the requirements of Section 141 cannot be said\n        to be satisfied.\n\n         (b) The answer to the question posed in sub-para (b) has to\n        be in the negative. Merely being a director of a company is\n        not sufficient to make the person liable under Section 141 of\n        the Act. A director in a company cannot be deemed to be in\n        charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of\n        its business. The requirement of Section 141 is that the\n        person sought to be made liable should be in charge of and\n        responsible for the conduct of the business of the company\n        at the relevant time. This has to be averred as a fact as\n        there is no deemed liability of a director in such cases.\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.                                                   Page 16 of 24\n\n\n\n\n         (c) The answer to Question (c) has to be in the affirmative.\n        The question notes that the managing director or joint\n        managing director would be admittedly in charge of the\n        company and responsible to the company for the conduct of\n        its business. When that is so, holders of such positions in a\n        company become liable under Section 141 of the Act. By\n        virtue of the office they hold as managing director or joint\n        managing director, these persons are in charge of and\n        responsible for the conduct of business of the company.\n        Therefore, they get covered under Section 141. So far as the\n        signatory of a cheque which is dishonoured is concerned,\n        he is clearly responsible for the incriminating act and will\n        be covered under sub-Section (2) of Section 141.\n\n                                                           (emphasis supplied)\n\n10.     In Gunmala Sales (P) Ltd. (supra), the issue brought before the\n\nSupreme Court by the complainant primarily was that the High Court\n\nin exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr. PC had wrongly\n\nquashed the proceedings against the respondents on the ground that\n\nthere was a bald assertion in the complaint that they were directors in\n\nthe company at the time when the offence was committed.  While\n\nacknowledging (in para 27) that the decision in SMS Pharmaceuticals\n\n(supra) still holds the field, in Gunmala Sales (P) Ltd.

This is a basic requirement.  There is no\n          deemed liability of such Directors.\u201d\n\n                                                           (emphasis supplied)\n\n11.     For cases where the allegations in the complaint in writing are\n\nnot deficient but the persons are described as directors  (who seek\n\nquashing of the summoning order), it was ruled in Gunmala Sales (P)\n\nLtd. (supra) as under :-\n\n          \u201c31. When in view of the basic averment process is issued\n          the complaint must proceed against the Directors. But, if\n          any Director wants the process to be quashed by filing a\n          petition under Section 482 of the Code on the ground that\n          only a bald averment is made in the complaint and that he\n          is really not concerned with the issuance of the cheque, he\n          must in order to persuade the High Court to quash the\n          process      either    furnish    some      sterling    incontrovertible\n          material or acceptable circumstances to substantiate his\n          contention. He must make out a case that making him\n          stand the trial would be an abuse of process of court. He\n          cannot get the complaint quashed merely on the ground\n          that apart from the basic averment no particulars are\n          given in the complaint about his role, because ordinarily\n          the basic averment would be sufficient to send him to trial\n          and it could be argued that his further role could be\n          brought out in the trial.

(supra)          were\n\nsummarized thus :-\n\n              \u201c35.         \u2026       Pertinently,               in     the       application               filed        by      the\n              respondents,                no      clear        case        was        made         out       that       at    the\n              material time, the Directors were not in charge of and were\n              not      responsible               for     the      conduct            of    the      business            of     the\n              Company by referring to or producing any incontrovertible\n              or unimpeachable evidence which is beyond suspicion or\n              doubt or any totally acceptable circumstances. It is merely\n              stated          that        Sidharth             Mehta            had         resigned             from         the\n              directorship                of      the       Company                on       30-9-2010                but        no\n              incontrovertible or unimpeachable evidence was produced\n              before the High Court as was done in Anita Malhotra\n              [Anita         Malhotra              v.

Similar is the case\n              with Kanhaiya Lal Mehta and Anu Mehta. Nothing was\n              produced to substantiate the contention that they were not\n              in charge of and not responsible for the conduct of the\n              business            of    the      Company               at     the      relevant            time.       In      the\n              circumstances,                  we       are       of     the      opinion           that       the       matter\n              deserves to be remitted to the High Court for fresh hearing.\n              However, we are inclined to confirm the order [Anu Mehta,\n              In re, 2012 SCC OnLine Cal 13134] passed by the High\n              Court         quashing             the      process           as     against           Shobha            Mehta.\n              Shobha Mehta is stated to be an old lady who is over 70\n              years        of     age.

The        above          view         in     Gunmala               Sales         (P)      Ltd.        (supra)          was\n\nendorsed and reiterated in Standard Chartered Bank (supra).\n\n14.         The guiding principles with reference to Section 141 of the\n\nNegotiable Instruments Act, 1881, which are now well settled by\n\njudicial pronouncements, some of which have been noted above, may\n\nbe summarised thus :-\n\n         (i)             It is only those persons who are in charge of or\n\n         responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at\n\n         the time of commission of the offence under Section 138 of\n\n         the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 who can be subjected to\n\n         criminal action with reference to Section 141;\n\n\n\n         (ii).           If the person committing an offence under Section\n\n         138  of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is a company,\n\n         the       person          who         was        signatory            to      the      cheque           which          is\n\n         dishonoured is clearly responsible for the incriminating act\n\n         and would be liable to be proceeded against under Section\n\n         141 (2);\n\n         (iii).          By virtue of the office they hold, the persons working\n\n         in the capacity of the Managing Director or Joint Managing\n\n         Director are deemed to be in charge of, and responsible for\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.                                                                                         Page 20 of 24\n\n\n\n\n          the conduct of the business of, the company and, therefore,\n\n          can be proceeded against in terms of Section 141;\n\n          (iv).           Merely because a person is a director of the company\n\n          is not  sufficient to make him liable under Section 141, there\n\n          being no deeming that by holding such position he is in\n\n          charge of, or responsible for the conduct of the business of,\n\n          the company within the meaning of Section 141;\n\n          (v).            It is necessary for the complainant to specifically aver\n\n          in the complaint that at the time the offence was committed,\n\n          the person sought to be prosecuted was in charge of, or\n\n          responsible for the conduct of the business of, the company in\n\n          terms          of      Section           141,         there         being          no      need         for       further\n\n          particulars to be given in the complaint about his role, this\n\n          being subject to proof at the trial;\n\n          (vi).           The person who has been summoned as an accused\n\n          for offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments\n\n          Act, 1881 on the basis of averment that he was director of the\n\n          company accused, he being in charge of or responsible for the\n\n          conduct of its business cannot get the complaint quashed by\n\n          the High Court by filing a petition under Section 482 of the\n\n          Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 merely on the ground that\n\n          no      particulars              as      to     his       role       have         been         set      out       in      the\n\n          complaint; and\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.                                                                                              Page 21 of 24\n\n\n\n\n         (vii).          The person who has been summoned as an accused\n\n         for offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments\n\n         Act, 1881 by invoking the provision contained in Section 141\n\n         may persuade the High Court to quash the process in exercise\n\n         of its inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of\n\n         Criminal              Procedure,              1973          by      furnishing              \u201csome           sterling\n\n         incontrovertible                     material             or       acceptable               circumstances\u201d\n\n         substantiating his contention that he was not in charge of nor\n\n         responsible for the conduct of the business of the company\n\n         \u201cat the time the offence was committed\u201d and thereby showing\n\n         a case that making him stand the trial would be an abuse of\n\n         the process of court, but not otherwise.\n\n15.         A perusal of the eleven complaints from which the present\n\nproceedings arise reveals that they are founded on identical averments\n\n(some          of     the      accused            who        are      not       before          this      court        being         not\n\ncommon), the exception being with regard to the particulars of the\n\ncheques or the background facts against which they had been issued or\n\nthe dates on which they were presented or dishonored leading to\n\ndemand notices in their respect being issued, there being no payment\n\nmade pursuant to such demand notices.  The averments crucial to pass\n\nthe muster of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881,\n\nhowever,             are      identically             worded            in     the      said       eleven          cases.            For\n\nillustration, the crucial averments appearing in one of such complaints\n\n(Crl. Complaint no.799/1/14), it being the first in chronology, may be\n\nextracted as under :-\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.

That despite the receipt of the above said Legal\n          Notice dated 05.02.2014, the Accused Persons have failed\n          / refused / neglected to make the payment of the above said\n          Cheques amount to the Complainant and have therefore\n          made themselves liable to be prosecuted under the\n          provisions of Sections 138, 141 and 142 of the Negotiable\n          Instruments Act, 1881.  It is further submitted that at the\n          time of issuance of the said cheques, the accused persons\n          have     assured,       promised        and     represented         to    the\n          Complainant that the said cheques would be honored on\n          presentation.  However, the said Cheques, which are the\n          subject matter of the present complaint, were dishonored\n          on presentment.  The accused persons have no intention to\n          make the said payment to the Complainant.  It is submitted\n          that the Accused Persons have been responsible for all the\n          business dealings for and on behalf of their said Accused\n          no.1 firm and also responsible for the circumstances that\n          have lead to the dishonor of the aid cheques issued to the\n          complainant.\u201d\n                                                           (emphasis supplied)\n\n16.     It is clear from the bare perusal of the above quoted averments\n\nthat they are deficient to the effect that there is not even a whisper of\n\nallegation that the respondents are persons who were in charge of or\n\nresponsible to the company accused for the conduct of its business \u201cat\n\nthe time the offence was committed\u201d.\n\nCrl.M.C. 3257/2016 & ors.                                                   Page 23 of 24\n\n\n\n\n17.         The respondents are not stated to be signatories to the cheques\n\nin question.  They cannot be roped in merely because they have been\n\ndirectors of the company accused.  The general averments that they\n\nwere         responsible                for       all       the       business             dealings             and        for       the\n\ncircumstances leading to the dishonour of the cheques or that they had\n\ngiven any assurance as to the cheques do not suffice.\n\n18.          The view taken by the revisional court, therefore, must be\n\nupheld.

On 17th July 2008, in these two petitions,\n\n this  Court issued notice for final disposal at\n\n the  admission stage.  Further submissions were\n\n heard by this Court on 21st August 2008 and 8th\n\n September 2008.\n\n 2.   When the petitions were placed before this\n\n Court  (Coram  :  V.K.Tahilramani, J.)  on  8th\n\n October  2008,  the  registry was  directed  to\n\n place  these  petitions before the Hon\u2019ble  the\n\n Chief  Justice  for  appropriate  orders  as  a\n\n contention  was raised that the petitions  have\n\n been  substantially  argued before this  Court.\n\n Accordingly,  by an administrative order  dated\n\n 20th  October  2008 passed by the  Hon\u2019ble  the\n\n Chief   Justice,  these   petitions  have  been\n\n assigned  to  this   Court.   Accordingly,  the\n\n petitions  were  taken up for final hearing  on\n\n 21st November 2008.\n\n 3.  It is not in dispute that the facts leading\n\n to  filing  of these two petitions are more  or\n\n less identical.  Therefore, a reference is made\n\n to  the  facts  of the case  in  Criminal  Writ\n\n Petition No.1444 of 2008.  The first respondent\n\n filed   a   private   complaint   against   the\n\n petitioners and four others alleging commission                                               ((-3-))\n\n of  an  offence  under section  138  read  with\n\n section  141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,\n\n 1881  (hereinafter  referred  to as  \"the  said\n\n Act\").  The complaint is based on eight cheques\n\n issued  by  M/s.Premier Explochem Limited  (the\n\n first   accused)  in  favour   of   the   first\n\n respondent   in   discharge  of   the   alleged\n\n liability  of  the said  M/s.Premier  Explochem\n\n Limited  (hereinafter referred to as \"the  said\n\n Company\").  The petitioners have been arrainged\n\n as   fifth  and  sixth   accused  in  the  said\n\n complaint.    As  stated   earlier,  the  first\n\n accused  is the said company.  The case of  the\n\n first  respondent made out in the complaint  is\n\n that  the  petitioners  along  with  second  to\n\n fourth  accused  are the Directors of the  said\n\n company.    The   fifth   accused  (the   first\n\n petitioner)  is  alleged to be the Chairman  of\n\n the said company.  It is stated that second and\n\n third  accused  are the Directors of  the  said\n\n company  and  also signatories to  the  cheques\n\n subject matter of the complaint.  It is alleged\n\n that  the  petitioners  and  second  to  fourth\n\n accused  have from time to time negotiated with\n\n the  first  respondent  and placed  orders  for\n\n supply  of  goods.   It  is  alleged  that  the\n\n petitioners  and second to fourth accused  from                                               ((-4-))\n\n time  to  time  promised that the dues  of  the\n\n first  respondent will be paid.  It is  alleged\n\n that  the  petitioners  and  second  to  fourth\n\n respondents are in-charge and in control of the\n\n day  to day affairs and management of the  said\n\n company  and  they  have issued  the  concerned\n\n cheques in consultation with each other.  It is\n\n alleged  that the petitioners and the second to\n\n fourth  accused  take decisions of day  to  day\n\n working  of  the  said  company  and  they  are\n\n responsible  for the conduct of the business of\n\n the  said company.  Further allegation made  in\n\n the  complaint is that the dishonoured  cheques\n\n were  not deposited for some time by the  first\n\n respondent   on  instructions  of   the   first\n\n petitioner.   The first respondent alleged that\n\n subsequently  on  instructions  being  received\n\n from  the  first petitioner and the second  and\n\n third  accused, the first respondent  deposited\n\n the cheques and the same were dishonoured.\n\n 4.   Verification  Statement  of  one  Mr.Shyam\n\n Manglunia   was   recorded   by   the   learned\n\n Metropolitan   Magistrate,  43rd    Court,   at\n\n Boriwali, Mumbai and process was issued against\n\n all  the  accused including the petitioners  on\n\n 2nd  September  2007 for an offence  punishable                                               ((-5-))\n\n under section 138 of the said Act.\n\n 5.    The   petitioners    filed   a   Revision\n\n Application  under  section 397 of the Code  of\n\n Criminal  Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred\n\n to  as  \"the  said Code\") before the  Court  of\n\n Sessions   for  Greater   Mumbai,  at  Dindoshi\n\n (Borivali  Division) for challenging the  order\n\n passed by the Magistrate of issuing the process\n\n on   the  private  complaint   of   the   first\n\n respondent.   The  learned Additional  Sessions\n\n Judge  dismissed the said revision  application\n\n by judgement and order dated 17th June 2008.\n\n 6.  By these petitions under Article 227 of the\n\n Constitution  of  India, the  petitioners  have\n\n challenged  the  order  passed by  the  learned\n\n magistrate  of  issuing process as well as  the\n\n order  passed by the Additional Sessions  Judge\n\n by which the revision application was rejected.\n\n 7.   The  learned Senior Counsel appearing  for\n\n the  petitioners  invited my attention  to  the\n\n averments  made in the complaint as well as  to\n\n the  verification  statement of the  authorised\n\n representative of the first respondent recorded\n\n by  the learned Magistrate.  He submitted  that                                               ((-6-))\n\n on  plain reading of the averments made in  the\n\n complaint  the  process  could  not  have  been\n\n issued  against  the  petitioners  as  material\n\n averments  in terms of Section 141 of the  said\n\n Act  have  not  been  made  in  the  complaint.\n\n Reliance  was placed on a decision of the  Apex\n\n Court in the case of S.M.S.Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\n\n Vs.  Neeta Bhalla and another ({2005}8-SCC-89).\n\n The  learned  Senior Counsel appearing for  the\n\n petitioners  also  relied upon the decision  of\n\n the   Apex  Court  in   the  case  of   Sabitha\n\n Ramamurthy    and     another    Vs.     R.B.S.\n\n Channabasavaradhya   ({2006}10-SCC-581).     He\n\n submitted  that  in  view  of  the  mandate  of\n\n Section  200  of  the   said  Code,  the  first\n\n respondent-  complainant  was   bound  to  make\n\n statements  on  oath as to how the offence  has\n\n been  committed  and  how the  petitioners  and\n\n other  accused  are responsible  therefor.   He\n\n also  relied  upon a decision of this Court  in\n\n the   case  of  Kapal   Mehra   Vs.    Indusind\n\n Enterprises      and          Finance      Ltd.\n\n (2007{6}-Mh.L.J.-58)  and  submitted  that  the\n\n persons  sought  to be made  criminally  liable\n\n under  section  141  must be in-charge  of  and\n\n responsible  for the conduct of the business of\n\n the  accused company.  Inviting my attention to                           ((-7-))\n\n paragraphs  25  and 26 of the said decision  of\n\n this  Court,  he  submitted  that  the  learned\n\n Magistrate while issuing the process cannot act\n\n casually.  He submitted that before issuing the\n\n process  the  learned  Magistrate is  under  an\n\n obligation  to scrutinise the averments made in\n\n the  complaint  as  well   as  in  verification\n\n statement.   He submitted that the verification\n\n statement is totally silent about the existance\n\n of  ingredients of the section 141 of the  said\n\n Act.\n\n 8.   He submitted that the petitioners in their\n\n alleged  capacity as Directors could have  been\n\n prosecuted  only by invoking Section 141 of the\n\n said  Act.  He pointed out that the process has\n\n been  issued only under section 138 of the said\n\n Act  and in the order issuing the process there\n\n is no reference to Section 141 of the said Act.\n\n He  submitted  that  the order of  the  learned\n\n Magistrate  shows  that the learned  magistrate\n\n was not satisfied that a case under section 141\n\n of  the  said Act was made out.   He  submitted\n\n that  the process under section 138 could  have\n\n been  issued  only against the company and  not\n\n against  its Directors especially when  Section\n\n 141 of the said Act is not invoked.                                               ((-8-))\n\n 9.    The   learned   Senior  Counsel   further\n\n submitted   that   in  paragraph   6   of   the\n\n verification statement the authorised signatory\n\n of  the first respondent-complainant has made a\n\n false  statement that there was no reply issued\n\n by  the accused to the statutory notice sent by\n\n the  first  respondent.  He submitted  that  on\n\n 16th  August 2007, a separate reply was sent by\n\n the  advocate for the petitioners on behalf  of\n\n the  petitioners.   He pointed out that  copies\n\n thereof have been annexed to the petitions.  He\n\n pointed  out  that  the  first  petitioner  has\n\n stated in the reply that till 29th June 2007 he\n\n was  never  in-charge of and in the control  of\n\n the  day  to day affairs of the company and  in\n\n fact  he  was not involved in the decisions  of\n\n the  day  to  day working of  the  company  and\n\n especially  the financial matters.  He  pointed\n\n out  that similar contention has been raised in\n\n the reply of the second petitioner.\n\n 10.   The submission made by the learned Senior\n\n Counsel  for the petitioners is that the  order\n\n passed by the learned Magistrate of issuing the\n\n process  against  the petitioners  is  patently\n\n illegal and the same deserves to be quashed.                           ((-9-))\n\n 11.   The  learned  counsel appearing  for  the\n\n first  respondent  submitted that there  is  no\n\n suppression  of  the facts in the  verification\n\n statement  as  the  reply   forwarded  by   the\n\n petitioners  on  16th  August   2007  was   not\n\n received  before  the complaint was filed  and,\n\n therefore,  there was no reference to the  said\n\n reply  of both the petitioners in the complaint\n\n as  well as in the verification statement.   He\n\n submitted  that the material averments in terms\n\n of  section 141 of the said Act have been  made\n\n in the complaint.  He submitted that the Income\n\n Tax Returns of the said company of the relevant\n\n years  have been signed by the first petitioner\n\n in  his  capacity as the Chairman of  the  said\n\n company.\n\n 12.   He submitted that the learned Magistrates\n\n in  the city of Mumbai who are dealing with the\n\n complaints  under  section 138 of the said  Act\n\n have been following a practice of recording the\n\n verification  statement of the complainants  in\n\n complaints under section 138 of the said Act in\n\n a particular format.  In fact, he has placed on\n\n record  verification  statements   recorded  by\n\n different Magistrates in the City in particular                                               ((-10-))\n\n formats.  His submission is that if the learned\n\n Magistrate   has   not   recorded  a   detailed\n\n verification   statement  of   the   authorised\n\n representative  of the first respondent  though\n\n the  said representative was willing to make  a\n\n detailed      statement,         the      first\n\n respondent-complainant  cannot  be  allowed  to\n\n suffer.   He submitted that at the highest this\n\n Court  may send back the matter to the  learned\n\n Magistrate  for  recording   the   verification\n\n statement  afresh.   He  pointed out  that  the\n\n material  averments as required by the decision\n\n of the Apex Court have been incorporated in the\n\n complaint.  He submitted that the issues raised\n\n in  these  petitions  by  the  petitioners  are\n\n purely  matters  of trial and the same  can  be\n\n gone into only after evidence is adduced.\n\n 13.   The learned Senior Counsel appearing  for\n\n the  petitioners submitted that as the  process\n\n could not have been issued on the basis of such\n\n cryptic  verification statement, the  complaint\n\n deserves  to  be  dismissed  and  there  is  no\n\n question  of  sending  back the  complaint  for\n\n recording a fresh verification statement.\n\n 14.    I   have    carefully   considered   the                                               ((-11-))\n\n submissions.   I have perused the complaint and\n\n other  annexures  to  the petitions.   At  this\n\n stage  the  question  which  will  have  to  be\n\n considered  is  whether a case is made out  for\n\n issuing  process as against the petitioners  on\n\n the  private  complaint  filed   by  the  first\n\n respondent.   In  paragraph 4 of the  complaint\n\n there  is  a  specific averment made  that  the\n\n second  to  sixth accused are all in-charge  of\n\n and  control  of  the day to  day  affairs  and\n\n management  of the accused no.1 company.  It is\n\n stated in paragraph 2 of the complaint that the\n\n accused  no.5  (the  first petitioner)  is  the\n\n Chairman  of the said company.  In paragraph  4\n\n of  the  complaint there is a further  averment\n\n that   the   second  to   sixth   accused   are\n\n responsible  for the conduct of the business of\n\n the  accused no.1 company.  Thus insofar as the\n\n complaint  is  concerned, there are  sufficient\n\n averments  made in compliance with Section  141\n\n of  the  said  Act.   There  is  a  substantial\n\n compliance  with the requirements laid down  by\n\n the    Apex    Court   in     the    case    of\n\n S.M.S.Pharmaceuticals (supra).\n\n 15.   The learned Senior Counsel appearing  for\n\n the  petitioners  submitted  that  the  learned                           ((-12-))\n\n Magistrate has not issued process under section\n\n 141  of  the  said   Act  and,  therefore,  the\n\n complaint  cannot proceed against the second to\n\n sixth  accused  and in particular  against  the\n\n petitioners.   He pointed out that the  process\n\n has  been issued only under section 138 of  the\n\n said  Act.   The  submission  is  that  if  the\n\n learned Magistrate was satisfied that a case to\n\n proceed  against the petitioners was made  out,\n\n the  process  ought to have been  issued  under\n\n section  138 read with section 141 of the  said\n\n Act.   For  dealing  with  this  submission,  a\n\n reference  will have to be made to sections 138\n\n and  141  of  the said Act.   The  Section  138\n\n introduces  a legal fiction which provides that\n\n in  case  of  dishonour  of  a  cheque  in  the\n\n situations  provided  for in the  section,  the\n\n drawer  of  the cheque shall be deemed to  have\n\n committed   an  offence.    The  said   section\n\n provides for a punishment for the said offence.\n\n Section 141 of the said Act reads thus :-\n\n          \"141.  Offences by companies.-\n\n          (1)  If the person committing an  offence\n          under  section  138 is a  company,  every\n          person  who, at the time the offence  was\n          committed,  was  in  charge of,  and  was\n          responsible   to  the   company  for  the\n          conduct  of the business of the  company,\n          as  well as the company, shall be  deemed\n          to  be guilty of the offence and shall be                           ((-13-))\n\n          liable   to  be   proceeded  against  and\n          punished accordingly :\n\n          Provided  that nothing contained in  this\n          sub-section  shall  render   any   person\n          liable  to  punishment if he proves  that\n          the  offence  was committed  without  his\n          knowledge,  or that he had exercised  all\n          due  digilence to prevent the  commission\n          of such offence :\n\n          (Provided  further that where a person is\n          nominated  as a Director of a company  by\n          virtue  of  his  holding  any  office  or\n          employment  in the Central Government  or\n          State   Government   or    a    financial\n          corporation  owned  or controlled by  the\n          Central   Government   or    the    State\n          Government,  as the case may be, he shall\n          not  be liable for prosecution under this\n          Chapter.)\n\n          (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in\n          sub  section (1), where any offence under\n          this  Act has been committed by a company\n          and  it  is proved that the  offence  has\n          been   committed  with   the  consent  or\n          connivance of, or is attributable to, any\n          neglect  on  the part of,  any  director,\n          manager,  secretary  or other officer  of\n          the  company,  such   director,  manager,\n          secretary  or other officer shall also be\n          deemed  to be guilty of that offence  and\n          shall  be liable to be proceeded  against\n          and punished accordingly.\"\n\n 16.   Section 141 does not create or define  an\n\n offence.   It only provides that if the  person\n\n committing  an  offence under section 138 is  a\n\n company,  every  person  who at  the  time  the\n\n offence was committed was in-charge of, and was\n\n responsible  to the company for the conduct  of\n\n the business of the company as well as company,\n\n shall  be  deemed to be guilty of  the  offence                                               ((-14-))\n\n under  section  138 and shall be liable  to  be\n\n proceeded  against  and  punished  accordingly.\n\n The  legal  effect of Section 141 is  that  the\n\n persons  referred  to in sub section 1  thereof\n\n shall  be  deemed to be guilty of  the  offence\n\n under  section  138  of the said Act  which  is\n\n committed  by  a company.  Thus, if a  case  is\n\n established  under  section  141,  the  persons\n\n referred  to  in sub section 1 thereof will  be\n\n punished  under  section 138 of the  said  Act.\n\n Thus,  if section 141 is applicable, the person\n\n concerned  can be punished under section 138 of\n\n the  said Act.  While issuing the process,  the\n\n Court  is required to mention the section under\n\n which  the  accused can be punished and/or  the\n\n section  which  defines  the offence.   If  the\n\n learned   Magistrate  on  the   basis  of   the\n\n averments  made in the complaint as well as the\n\n verification  of  the complainant is  satisfied\n\n that  the complainant has made out a case under\n\n section  141,  he  can issue  process  for  the\n\n offence  punishable  under section 138  of  the\n\n said  Act  against the company as well  as  the\n\n Directors  or  the persons referred to  in  sub\n\n section   1   of    section    141.    In   the\n\n circumstances,  there  is no merit in the  said\n\n grievance made by the petitioners.                           ((-15-))\n\n 17.  The main submissions have been made on the\n\n verification  statement of one Shyam  Manglunia\n\n which  is  annexed at page 32 of the  petition.\n\n The said statement contains numbered paragraphs\n\n having  titles  such as the cheque number,  the\n\n cheque date, the cheque amount, the name of the\n\n drawer\u2019s  bank, the name of the drawee\u2019s  bank,\n\n the  date  of presentation of the  cheque,  the\n\n date  of receiving the intimation from the bank\n\n of  dishonour of the cheque, the date of notice\n\n of demand, the date of service of notice to the\n\n drawer,  the date of receipt of reply-if any of\n\n the   drawer  and  the   date  of  filing   the\n\n complaint.   In  the   verification   statement\n\n necessary  particulars  have   been  filled  in\n\n against  the  item numbers referred  to  above.\n\n Thus,  the  verification statement recorded  in\n\n these two cases is in a pre-conceived format in\n\n which  necessary particulars referred to  above\n\n are filled in.\n\n 18.   Before dealing with the effect of such  a\n\n verification statement, it will be necessary to\n\n consider  the  object  of the  statement  under\n\n section  200.   Section  200 of the  said  Code\n\n reads thus:-                           ((-16-))\n\n          \"S.200.  Examination of complainant.-\n\n          A  Magistrate  taking  cognizance  of  an\n          offence  on complaint shall examine  upon\n          oath  the  complainant and the  witnesses\n          present,  if  any, and the  substance  of\n          such  examination  shall  be  reduced  to\n          writing  and  shall  be   signed  by  the\n          complainant  and the witnesses, and  also\n          by the Magistrate;\n\n          Provided that, when the complaint is made\n          in  writing,  the   Magistrate  need  not\n          examine   the    complainant    and   the\n          witnesses-\n\n          (a)  if  a  public   servant  acting   or\n          purporting to act in the discharge of his\n          official  duties or a Court has made  the\n          complaint;  or\n\n          (b) if the Magistrate makes over the case\n          for   inquiry   or   trial   to   another\n          Magistrate under section 192;\n\n          Provided  further that if the  Magistrate\n          makes over the case to another Magistrate\n          under  section  192 after  examining  the\n          complainant and the witnesses, the latter\n          Magistrate need not re-examine them.\"\n\n 19.   The  Apex Court in the case of  Nirmaljit\n\n Singh  Hoon  Vs.  The State of West Bengal  and\n\n another  ({1973}3-SCC-753)  had an occasion  to\n\n consider  the provisions of Section 200 of  the\n\n said  Code.   It will be necessary to refer  to\n\n what  is  held by the Apex Court  in  paragraph\n\n no.22 :-\n\n          \"22.  ...  ...  ...  Where a complaint is                           ((-17-))\n\n          presented   before  him,  he  can   under\n          Section   200  take   cognizance  of  the\n          offence  made out therein and has then to\n          examine  the complaint and his witnesses.\n          The  object  of  such examination  is  to\n          ascertain  whether there is a prima facie\n          case  against  the person accused of  the\n          offence  in the complaint, and to prevent\n          the issue of process on a complaint which\n          is  either false or vexatious or intended\n          only  to  harass  such  a  person.   Such\n          examination is provided therefore to find\n          out  whether  there is or not  sufficient\n          ground                     for                   proceeding.\"\n                                          (emphasis supplied)\n\n This  Court had an occasion to consider Section\n\n 200  of  the said Code in the Case  of  Captain\n\n Lance  Irwin Lobo Vs.  Ismail D\u2019Souza @  Angelo\n\n Ismail  de  Souzla  and  another  (2007-ALL  MR\n\n {Cri}-623).   It  will  be necessary  to  refer\n\n paragraph  16  of the said judgement  in  which\n\n this Court has held thus :-\n\n          \"16.  ...  ...  ...  The recording of the\n          statement  on  oath  of  the  complainant\n          under  Section  200  Cr.P.C.  is  not  an\n          empty   formality.    Commonly    it   is\n          nicknamed  as  verification.   To  verify\n          means  to establish the truth.  In  other\n          words,  verification is done in order  to\n          ascertain  as  to what is pleaded by  the\n          complainant is true or not.  It is with a\n          view  to separate chaff from the grain as\n          many   a  times   complaints  do  contain\n          unfounded  allegations and it is the duty\n          of  the  Court  to ensure  that  what  is\n          stated in the complaint is also stated by\n          the  complainant  on oath and it is  only\n          then  that  based on such statement  that\n          process  can be issued.  The corollary of\n          this  would  be that unless offences  are\n          disclosed  from the statement on oath, no\n          process  can  be  issued  only  based  on                           ((-18-))\n\n          averments   in   the    complaint.    The\n          complainant  is bound to make a statement\n          on  oath  as  to   how  the  offence  was\n          committed and how the accused persons are\n          responsible   therefore.      After   the\n          statement   on   oath  is   recorded,   a\n          Magistrate  is  required  to  apply   his\n          judicial  mind  to the facts of the  case\n          and  the law applicable thereto and  find\n          out   what   offence/s   is   made   out,\n          notwithstanding  that the other party  at\n          that stage is unrepresented.  As observed\n          by  the  Apex  Court   time  and   again,\n          summoning  of  an accused in  a  criminal\n          case is a serious matter and criminal law\n          cannot  be set into motion as a matter of\n          course.   A  Magistrate  is  required  to\n          examine  the  nature of  the  allegations\n          made  in  the complaint and the  evidence\n          both oral and documentary to see if it is\n          sufficient for the complainant to succeed\n          in  bringing charge home to the  accused.\n          In  other  words, the examination of  the\n          complainant on oath is for the purpose of\n          ascertaining  whether a prima facie  case\n          is  made out against the accused to issue\n          process  so that the issue of process  is\n          prevented  on a complaint which is either\n          false  or  vexatious or intended only  to\n          harass.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\n 20.   The learned Senior Counsel appearing  for\n\n the  petitioners has relied upon a decision  of\n\n the  Apex Court in the case of Sabita Rammurthy\n\n and   another    Vs.    R.B.S.Channabasavardhya\n\n ({2006}10-SCC-581).   In the said judgement the\n\n Apex  Court has dealt with the requirements  of\n\n Section  141  of the said Act.  The Apex  Court\n\n followed  its  earlier decision in the case  of\n\n S.M.S.Pharmaceuticals  (supra)  to   hold  that\n\n before  a person can be held vicariously liable\n\n under   section  141  of   the  said  Act,  the                           ((-19-))\n\n complaint  must demonstrate that the  statutory\n\n requirements  contained  in Section 141 of  the\n\n said  Act  have been complied with.   The  Apex\n\n Court held that it may not be necessary for the\n\n complainant  to  specifically   reproduce   the\n\n wordings of the section but what is required is\n\n a  clear statement of fact so as to enable  the\n\n Court  to arrive at a prima facie opinion  that\n\n the  accused are vicariously liable.  The  Apex\n\n Court thereafter dealt with the statement under\n\n section  200 of the said Code.  In paragraph  7\n\n the Apex Court observed thus :-\n\n          \"...   ...  ...  In terms of Section  200\n          of  the  Code of Criminal Procedure,  the\n          complainant  is bound to make  statements\n          on  oath  as to how the offence has  been\n          committed and how the accused persons are\n          responsible therefor.  ...  ...\"\n\n Relying  upon  the  said decision of  the  Apex\n\n Court in the case of Sabitha Ramamurthy (supra)\n\n the  learned Single Judge of this Court in  the\n\n case  of  Kapal  Mehra  (supra)  construed  the\n\n provisions  of Sections 138 and 141 of the said\n\n Act and in paragraph 25 observed as under:-\n\n          \"25.   A  magistrate issuing  process  is\n          expected  to act meticulously and examine\n          the  averments made in the complaint  and\n          verification  of  statement  in  such  or\n          similar  cases  more carefully, when  the                           ((-20-))\n\n          prosecution is under special legislation.\n          It  is  true  that the  evidence  is  not\n          required  to be pleaded but there has  to\n          be  a  basic  averment as to how  one  is\n          involved in the alleged crime.\"\n\n 21.   The statement contemplated by section 200\n\n of  the said Code is the first statement of the\n\n complainant on oath recorded by the Court.  The\n\n requirement of recording a statement on oath of\n\n the  complainant  is  not an  empty  formality.\n\n Before  a  Division Bench of this Court in  the\n\n case  of  Maharaja Developers and  another  Vs.\n\n Udaysingh  Pratapsingbhrao Bhosale and  another\n\n (2007-Cr.L.J.-2207)  an issue arose whether  in\n\n the  light  of non obstante clause in  Sections\n\n 142 and 145 of the said Act is it mandatory for\n\n the  Magistrate  before  issue  of  process  to\n\n examine the complainant in a complaint alleging\n\n an  offence under section 138 of who has  filed\n\n the  complaint  with   affirmation  as  regards\n\n truthfulness  of  the  facts mentioned  in  the\n\n complaint.   One of the submissions made before\n\n the  Division  Bench was that if the  complaint\n\n alleging  offence under section 138 is affirmed\n\n by the complainant reiterating the truthfulness\n\n of the averments made therein, there may not be\n\n any  requirement of recording a statement under\n\n section  200  of the said Code.   The  Division                                               ((-21-))\n\n Bench  held that the Magistrate is obliged  and\n\n duty bound to examine upon oath the complainant\n\n before  issuance  of process though there is  a\n\n solemn affirmation at the foot of the complaint\n\n by the complainant.\n\n 22.   On  plain reading of Section 200  of  the\n\n said  Code it appears that it is the obligation\n\n of  the  Magistrate to examine the  complainant\n\n which  means  that  the learned  Magistrate  is\n\n obliged to put questions to the complainant for\n\n eliciting  the  truth  from   him.   The   said\n\n provision  enjoins  a  judicial   duty  to   be\n\n performed  by  the  Judicial  Magistrate  which\n\n requires  an application of judicial mind.  The\n\n said  work of recording the statement cannot be\n\n done  mechanically  by simply  filling  details\n\n such  as the date of cheque, name of the  bank,\n\n date  of intimation of dishonour of the  cheque\n\n etc;   in a format which is already kept ready.\n\n Generally,  the  complaints are drafted by  the\n\n lawyers   as  per  the   instructions  of   the\n\n complainants.    Thus,  a   complaint  is   the\n\n translated version or a formulated version made\n\n by  the  advocate on the instructions  received\n\n from   the    complainant.     Therefore,   the\n\n examination  of  the complainant under  section                                               ((-22-))\n\n 200   by  the  learned   Magistrate   is   very\n\n important.    During   the   course   of   such\n\n examination  the  complainant tells the  truth.\n\n In  fact, the object of the learned  Magistrate\n\n recording  such  statement is of eliciting  the\n\n truth  from the complainant.  Therefore,  while\n\n recording  a statement under section 200 of the\n\n said  Code  in  such a complaint,  the  learned\n\n Magistrate  cannot merely reproduce the data in\n\n a  pre-conceived  format.   He   must  give  an\n\n opportunity  to  the complainant to  state  and\n\n describe  the  role  played   by  the   accused\n\n especially when directors/officers of a company\n\n are  sought to be held vicariously liable.  The\n\n object of examination is that a true version on\n\n oath of the complainant is brought on record.\n\n 23.   Now  coming  back  to the  facts  of  the\n\n present  case, it is obvious that the statement\n\n of  the  complainant has been recorded  by  the\n\n learned   Magistrate  in  a  format  which  was\n\n already  kept  ready   before  commencement  of\n\n recording  of  the statement.  In  a  statement\n\n under  section 200, the complainant is required\n\n to  make out a case against the accused showing\n\n their complicity or involvement in the offence.\n\n In  a  given case and especially in case  of  a                           ((-23-))\n\n complaint  under  section 138 of the said  Act,\n\n the  particulars which are incorporated in  the\n\n verification  statement may necessarily form  a\n\n part  of  the verification statement, but in  a\n\n case  where the complainant wants to show  that\n\n the   Officers/Directors  of  a   company   are\n\n vicariously  liable, the complainant will  have\n\n to  set  out  on  oath  whether  the  concerned\n\n persons  were  in-charge  of  at  the  time  of\n\n commission  of the offence and were responsible\n\n to the company for the conduct of its business.\n\n If  a  verification statement  is  mechanically\n\n recorded  in  a  format, it is obvious  that  a\n\n complainant  will be deprived of an opportunity\n\n to disclose the material particulars of factual\n\n aspects on oath.\n\n 24.   When  this  petition was  heard  on  21st\n\n August  2008 the learned counsel appearing  for\n\n the  first respondent stated that many  learned\n\n Magistrates  in the City of Mumbai dealing with\n\n complaints  under  section 138 of the said  Act\n\n are recording verification statements only in a\n\n pre-conceived  format.  For the perusal of  the\n\n Court  the  learned counsel appearing  for  the\n\n first  respondent  has  placed on  record  true\n\n copies  of verification statements recorded  by                                               ((-24-))\n\n different  Metropolitan Magistrates in the City\n\n of  Mumbai  in complaints under section 138  of\n\n the  said  Act.  Perusal of the copies  of  the\n\n said  statements supports the factual statement\n\n made  by  the  learned  counsel.   The  learned\n\n Magistrate  has  to  perform   his  duty  under\n\n section  200  of  the   said  Code  by  putting\n\n questions  to  the  complainant   so  that  the\n\n complainant  can  state before the Court as  to\n\n how  the  accused  named in the  complaint  are\n\n liable.\n\n 25.   Thus,  in the present case,  the  learned\n\n Magistrate  has  not performed his  duty  under\n\n section  200 of the said Code.  The complainant\n\n cannot  be allowed to suffer merely because the\n\n learned Magistrate has not performed his duty.\n\n 26.   The learned senior counsel appearing  for\n\n the   petitioners   submitted   that  a   false\n\n statement  has been made by the complainant  in\n\n item  no.6  of  the verification  statement  by\n\n stating  that there was no reply to the  notice\n\n of demand.  The response of the learned counsel\n\n for the first respondent was that till the date\n\n of  filing the complaint, the reply sent by the\n\n petitioners   was   not     received   by   the                           ((-25-))\n\n complainant.   The petitioners have not annexed\n\n the  copies  of   the  acknowledgement  showing\n\n receipt  of the said reply by the advocate  for\n\n the  first  respondent-complainant on any  date\n\n prior  to  the  date  of  institution  of   the\n\n complaint.   Therefore, this aspect is a matter\n\n of  evidence and the complaint cannot be thrown\n\n out on this ground at this stage.\n\n 27.   As the approach of the learned Magistrate\n\n was  completely erroneous, while exercising the\n\n power  under Article 227 of the Constitution of\n\n India  and under section 482 of the said  Code,\n\n this  Court will have to ensure that a litigant\n\n should  not suffer due to lapse on the part  of\n\n learned  Magistrate.   The   order  of  process\n\n passed  without  recording proper  verification\n\n will  have  to be naturally set aside  but  the\n\n complaint   will  have  to   be  remanded   and\n\n relegated  to the stage of recording  statement\n\n under  section  200  of the said  Code  with  a\n\n direction  to the learned Magistrate to  record\n\n the  statement  under section 200 of  the  Code\n\n afresh  in  accordance  with law.   This  is  a\n\n peculiar  case where the learned Judge has  not\n\n performed  his duty.  Merely because there  are\n\n defects  in  the  verification  statement,  the                                               ((-26-))\n\n aforesaid  course  cannot  be  adopted.    This\n\n course  of sending the complainant back to  the\n\n Magistrate  is  required to be adopted  as  the\n\n learned   Magistrate  has   acted  contrary  to\n\n section 200 of the said Code.\n\n 28.  Hence, I pass following order :-\n\n (a)  The  impugned orders of issue  of  process\n\n dated  7th September 2007 passed by the learned\n\n Magistrate   are   quashed   and   set   aside.\n\n Consequently,  the judgements and orders  dated\n\n 17th June 2008 passed by the learned Additional\n\n Sessions Judge is quashed and set aside;\n\n (b)  The learned Metropolitan Magistrate,  43rd\n\n Court,   Borivali,  Mumbai   will  record   the\n\n statement  of the complainant under section 200\n\n of  the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 afresh\n\n in  accordance  with  law in the light  of  the\n\n observations  made  in this  judgement.   After\n\n recording  of  the verification statement,  the\n\n learned  Magistrate will pass appropriate order\n\n on  the complaint in accordance with law.   All\n\n questions on merits are kept open;\n\n (c) The Registrar, Judicial(I) will ensure that                           ((-27-))\n\n a  copy of this judgement is circulated to  all\n\n learned Metropolitan Magistrates in the City of\n\n Mumbai;\n\n (d)  The  petitions are partly allowed  in  the\n\n above terms with no orders as to costs.\n\n                                             (A.S.OKA, J.)"

The trial\n\ncourt also directed that, if the fine amount was realised, it shall\n\nbe paid as compensation to the complainant.Crl.R.P.No.186/2020                                                  3\n\n           3.         The petitioner filed Crl.A.No.128/2019 before the\n\nCourt of Session, Alappuzha challenging the order of conviction\n\nand sentence passed against him by the trial court.                                                                               The\n\nappellate court confirmed the conviction as well as the sentence\n\nagainst the petitioner and dismissed the appeal.\n\n           4.         Aggrieved                 by        the        concurrent                  findings             of       guilty,\n\nconviction and sentence made against him by the courts below,\n\nthe accused has filed this revision petition.\n\n           5.         Heard learned counsel for the revision petitioner.\n\n           6.         The case of the complainant is as follows:                                                                  The\n\ncomplainant is the owner of the establishment by name \u201cAlleppey\n\nParcel Service\u201d.  The accused came to know that the complainant\n\nwas in search of a suitable property including a building for\n\nstarting a branch of his establishment at Kuttanelloor in Thrissur\n\nDistrict.  The accused informed the complainant that he would\n\nsell his property having an extent of 8.910 cents and the building\n\nsituated there.  The accused and the complainant entered into an\n\nagreement for sale of the property.  The accused received a total\n\namount              of       Rs.7,00,000/-                     from           the        complainant                    in      threeCrl.R.P.No.186/2020                                                  4\n\ninstalments and he handed over possession of the building to the\n\ncomplainant.                   Thereafter,                 the        complainant                   was          running              his\n\nestablishment                    in       the        aforesaid               property.                   Meanwhile,                  the\n\ncomplainant came to know that the accused had mortgaged the\n\naforesaid property to the bank for availing loan and that the\n\naforesaid property was attached in a suit pending before the Sub\n\nCourt, Thrissur.  When enquired about it, the accused admitted\n\nthe aforesaid fact.  Then, the complainant filed a case against the\n\naccused                in         the           Magistrate's                     Court             at          Thrissur                as\n\nC.C.No.482/2015.  Subsequently, settlement talks were made by\n\nthe complainant and the accused in the presence of mediators\n\nand the accused signed and issued a cheque dated 01.03.2017\n\nfor Rs.7,00,000/- in discharge of the amount which he had\n\nobtained from the complainant.  The complainant presented the\n\ncheque in the bank.  It was returned unpaid for the reason that\n\nthere was no sufficient amount in the account of the accused.\n\nThe complainant sent a lawyer notice to the accused demanding\n\npayment of the amount of the cheque.  The accused received the\n\nnotice.  He did not send any reply.  He did not pay the amount ofCrl.R.P.No.186/2020                                                  5\n\nthe cheque.\n\n           7.         During the trial of the case, the complainant got\n\nhimself examined as PW1 and Exts.P1 to P7 documents were\n\nmarked on his side.  No evidence was adduced by the accused.\n\n           8.         When             examined                 as       PW1,           the        complainant                   gave\n\nevidence that he entered into an agreement with the accused for\n\npurchase of the property owned by the accused and he gave\n\nRs.7,00,000/- to the accused in three instalments and the\n\npossession of the property was given to him by the accused.\n\nPW1 also gave evidence regarding the circumstances under\n\nwhich the accused issued Ext.P1 cheque dated 01.03.2017 for\n\nRs.7,00,000/- to him in discharge of the liability.\n\n           9.         The          complainant                   produced                certified            copy          of       the\n\ncompromise petition (Ext.P6) filed in the case C.C.No.482/2015\n\nand certified copy of the order (Ext.P7) passed by the court in\n\nthat case.  Ext.P6 document clinches the issue.  The trial court\n\nhas stated in the judgment as follows:\n\n                                  \u201cOn perusal of Ext.P6 document, it is seen\n                      that both the complainant and the accused and\n                      their counsel have signed the said document andCrl.R.P.No.186/2020                             6\n\n                the issuance of cheque involved in this case is\n                specifically seen mentioned.                Ext.P7 order was\n                passed compounding the matter based on Ext.P6.\n                The above facts would prove the issuance of\n                Ext.P1 cheque in favour of the complainant.  The\n                liability to pay the said amount is also seen\n                admitted in Ext.P6.\u201d\n        10.  The appellate court has dealt with the evidence in this\n\nregard in the following manner:\n\n                        \u201cDuring cross examination of PW1, there was\n                suggestion that cheque number was inserted in\n                Ext.P6 subsequently.  In this case, Ext.P6 and P7\n                are very vital documents.  Ext.P6 is the certified\n                copy of compromise petition signed between the\n                complainant and the accused.  In Ext.P6 there is\n                clear    mention       that     cheque       No.391168         dated\n                01.03.2017 of Axis Bank Ltd., Thrissur branch was\n                issued as part of settlement.  The contention of\n                the     accused       is    that     cheque        number        was\n                subsequently inserted in Ext.P6 could not be\n                believed at all as the same is a record of a court of\n                law where from certified copies were obtained.  In\n                fact, Ext.P6 takes away the entire defence case.\n                Similarly, Ext.P7 would go to show that in view of\n                the compromise recorded as per Ext.P6 in that\n                case was closed.  Here, evidently as per Ext.P6, itCrl.R.P.No.186/2020                             7\n\n                could be gathered that the matter was settled\n                before filing Ext.P6 compounding petition and\n                Ext.P1 cheque was issued.  However, compounding\n                was recorded only on 07.04.2017.  Thus, there is\n                no     reason      to    disbelieve        the    case      of    the\n                complainant that the accused settled the dispute in\n                the matter of property sale and in consequence\n                thereof, Ext.P1 was issued.\u201d\n                                                       (emphasis supplied).\n\n        11.       The contents of Ext.P6 document corroborate the\n\nevidence of PW1 regarding the liability and execution of Ext.P1\n\ncheque by the accused in discharge of the liability and delivery of\n\nit by him to the complainant.\n\n        12.     Even otherwise, since the evidence of the complainant\n\nproves execution of Ext.P1 cheque by the accused, the presumption\n\nunder Section 139 of the Act comes into play.  The burden is upon the\n\naccused to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the Act.  No\n\nevidence was adduced by the accused to rebut the presumption.\n\nNothing was also brought out in the cross-examination of PW1 to rebut\n\nthe presumption.\n\n        13.     When examined under Section 313 Cr.P.C, the plea of the\n\naccused was that there was no agreement between him and theCrl.R.P.No.186/2020                                                  8\n\ncomplainant but the complainant had run his establishment in his\n\nproperty.  The accused admitted the fact that the case C.C.No.482/15\n\nwas           filed          against               him           by          the          complainant                     in        the\n\nMagistrate's Court at Thrissur.  His plea was that Exts.P6 and P7\n\nwere forged documents.  It is relevant here to note that Exts.P6\n\nand P7 are certified copies of the documents in the case\n\nC.C.No.482 of 2015 between the parties.\n\n           14.        Moreover, the accused has not offered any satisfactory\n\nexplanation as to how the cheque bearing his signature happened\n\nto be in the possession of the complainant.\n\n           15.        The complainant had sent statutory notice to the\n\naccused demanding payment of the amount of the cheque.\n\nThough the accused denied receipt                                                       of the notice,                      Ext.P5\n\nacknowledgment card would show that he had received the\n\nnotice.  He did not send any reply to the statutory notice.  If he\n\nhad         not        received              an        amount               of      Rs.7,00,000/-                     from           the\n\ncomplainant before handing over possession of his property to\n\nthe complainant and if he had not issued the cheque to the\n\ncomplainant in discharge of the aforesaid liability, the accusedCrl.R.P.No.186/2020                             9\n\nwould have definitely sent a reply to the notice.  Silence  and\n\ninaction on the part of the petitioner/accused after receiving the\n\nstatutory notice from the complainant lead to an inference that\n\nthe case of the complainant is true.\n\n        16.     Learned counsel for the petitioner would point out that\n\nthe complainant did not produce the agreement allegedly\n\nexecuted by him and the petitioner for purchase/sale of the\n\nproperty.        Non-production of the aforesaid document by the\n\ncomplainant does not, in any way, help the accused to rebut the\n\npresumption under Section 139 of the Act.  The complainant is\n\nnot expected to prove the debt or the original transaction as in a\n\nsuit for realisation of money (See                      Uttam Ram v. Devinder\n\nSingh : (2019) 10 SCC 287).\n\n        17.     Very recently, the Apex Court has held in Chandel v.\n\nM/s.Wockhardt Limited                       (2020 (1) KLT 660 (SC)                          that\n\ndocuments showing the original transaction may be relevant in\n\nthe civil court but may not be so in a case filed under Section\n\n138 of the Act.\n\n        18.     The courts below have appreciated the evidence andCrl.R.P.No.186/2020                                                 10\n\nmade concurrent findings. I find no illegality, impropriety or\n\nperversity in the appreciation of evidence and the findings made\n\nby the courts below.  Ordinarily, in revisional jurisdiction, it would\n\nnot be appropriate for this Court to reappreciate the evidence\n\nand come to its own conclusion, when the evidence has already\n\nbeen appreciated by the Magistrate as well as the Sessions Judge\n\nin appeal, unless any glaring feature is brought to the notice of\n\nthis        Court            which            would             otherwise                tantamount                    to       gross\n\nmiscarriage of justice. The revisional court is not meant to act as\n\nan appellate court.                             Unless the finding of the court, whose\n\ndecision is sought to be revised, is shown to be perverse or\n\nuntenable                 in       law         or        is      grossly             erroneous                  or       glaringly\n\nunreasonable or where the decision is based on no material or\n\nwhere the material facts are wholly ignored or where the judicial\n\ndiscretion is exercised arbitrarily or capriciously, the High Court\n\nshall not interfere with such finding or decision in exercise of its\n\nrevisional jurisdiction (See Kishan Rao v. Shankargouda : AIR\n\n2018 SC 3173). Conviction of the petitioner/accused for the\n\noffence under Section 138 of the Act is only to be confirmed.Crl.R.P.No.186/2020                                                 11\n\n           19.        The trial court has shown maximum leniency in\n\nawarding sentence on the petitioner/accused.  There is also no\n\nsufficient ground to interfere with the sentence imposed on the\n\npetitioner/accused.\n\n           20.        Consequently, the revision petition is dismissed.  The\n\norder           of        conviction                 and           sentence                passed               against              the\n\npetitioner/accused by the trial court under Section 138 of the\n\nAct, which stands affirmed by the appellate court, is confirmed.\n\nHowever, the petitioner is granted a period of four months from\n\ntoday to remit the fine amount in the trial court.\n\n                                                                                           (sd/-)\njsr                                                    R.NARAYANA PISHARADI, JUDGE\n\n                    TRUE COPY\n                                      PS TO JUDGE"

The parties hereto shall be referred to in the names as they appear in\n\nthe cause title of the complaint.\n\n3.      The Complainant was an employee of accused nos. 2 and 3 whose\n\nservices were terminated with effect from 16/06/1991.  The accused no. 1\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the accused) was the Managing Director of accused\n\nno. 2, a company, and partner of A3, a firm.  Although, three accused were\n\nprosecuted in the said complaint case and all were acquitted, by order of this\n\nCourt dated 19/01/2006 leave to appeal was granted only against the accused-\n\nNarayan R. Bandekar, as the the subject cheque of Rs. 30,000/- was issued by\n\nhim in his personal capacity towards the liability which respondents No. 2\n\nand 3 owed to the Complainant.\n\n4.      The termination of the services of the Complainant resulted in\n\nproceedings being filed before the Industrial Tribunal and they ended in an\n\naward dated 24/09/2001 which was the result of settlement arrived at between\n\nthe parties on 6/09/2001.            As per the said settlement/award the first\n\ninstalment of Rs. 10,000/- was to be paid to the Complainant on 17/08/2001,\n\nthe second instalment of Rs. 20,000/- was to be paid on 7/09/2001, the third\n\ninstalment of Rs. 30,000/- was to be paid on or before 30/10/2001 and the\n\nfinal instalment of Rs. 31,600/- was to be paid on or before 30/11/2001.                                              3\n\n5.      The complaint was filed on 29/01/2002.  As per the Complainant, the\n\nsaid settlement before the Industrial Tribunal on behalf of the accused nos. 2\n\nand 3 was signed by the accused who was the Managing Director of accused\n\nno. 2/company and accused no.3/firm.  It was the case of the Complainant\n\nthat towards the payment of the third instalment of Rs. 30,000/- the accused\n\ngave to the Complainant cheque dated 15/11/2001 for Rs. 30,000/- issued on\n\nDevelopment Credit Bank, Vasco-da-Gama, Goa.  As per the Complainant,\n\nthe said cheque was drawn by the accused for and on behalf of the accused\n\nnos. 2 and 3.\n\n6.      The Complainant presented the said cheque for payment, first on\n\n27/11/2001 to the drawee bank, and it was returned with remark, \u201crefer to\n\ndrawer\u201d whereupon the Complainant again presented the said cheque on\n\n12/12/2001 but this time the drawee bank returned the same dishonoured for\n\ninsufficient funds in the account of the accused who was the drawer of the\n\nsaid cheque.\n\n7.      The Complainant sent the notice dated 17/12/2001 by registered post\n\nA/D to the accused and demanded the payment of the amount mentioned in\n\nthe said cheque within 15 days of the receipt of the notice and according to\n\nthe Complainant, the accused refused to accept the said notice and therefore\n\naccording to the Complainant it was good service.  As per the Complainant,                                              4\n\nthe said notice was issued to the accused as the said cheque was drawn by\n\nhim.  The Complainant stated that the said accused was also the Managing\n\nDirector of A2/Company and partner of A3/firm and hence it was a deemed\n\nnotice to accused nos. 2 and 3.\n\n8.      The Complainant stated that the said cheque was issued by the accused\n\ntowards the discharge of their liability to the Complainant.  However, the\n\nbankers of the accused dishonoured the cheque as the funds were insufficient\n\nin the account of the accused and the accused failed to make the payment\n\nwithin 15 days despite receiving the said notice, demanding the payment of\n\nthe said dishonoured cheque.\n\n9.      In support of his case, the Complainant had examined himself and the\n\nManagers of his bank where the cheque was deposited as well as the bank of\n\nthe accused.  The accused did not lead any evidence but it was the case of the\n\naccused that he had given instructions to withhold the payment.  The accused\n\nalso stated that he had stood as a surety.\n\n10.     After filing of the complaint on 29/01/2002, the case was fixed for\n\nsettlement from time to time and the Complainant was paid Rs. 45,000/- on\n\n13/11/2002.  Further amounts  of Rs.7,000/- and Rs. 8,000/- were paid on\n\n23/12/2002 and 27/01/2003, respectively.  The substance of accusation was                                              5\n\nframed on 23/07/2003, and, in the course of his evidence the complainant\n\nadmitted that he had received Rs. 30,000/- from his employer i.e. accused\n\nno.2, after filing the complaint and he had also received a further amount of\n\nRs. 60,000/- from the accused.  The Complainant also admitted that he had\n\nreceived the entire amount due of Rs. 91,600/- under the said award.\n\n11.     The learned Magistrate came to the conclusion that the Complainant\n\nhad filed the present complaint against the accused in the capacity of\n\nManaging Director of accused no.2.  The learned Magistrate also came to the\n\nconclusion that after filing the complaint, the Complainant received first Rs.\n\n30,000/- and then Rs. 60,000/- and being so, the learned Magistrate observed\n\nthat she failed to understand on what basis the Complainant had filed the\n\ncomplaint and further came to the conclusion that the Complainant had the\n\nintention of grabbing extra amount for which the Complainant was not\n\nentitled to.  In case the accused no.2 had paid to the Complainant Rs.\n\n45,000/- as on 13/11/2002 and thereby the amount due on the subject cheque\n\nof Rs. 30,000/- one fails to understand as to why the learned Magistrate\n\nproceeded to explain a substance of accusation to the accused on 23/07/2003\n\nin case subsequent payment had the effect of                    wiping    out the offence\n\ncommitted by the accused.  As regards the notice, the learned Magistrate\n\ncame to the conclusion that there was no provision in the Act to send notice\n\nto one accused which would comply with the requirement of sending notice                                              6\n\nto all the accused, in one envelope and since the notice was sent in one\n\nenvelope to all the three accused, jointly addressed to them, the complaint\n\nwas not maintainable.\n\n12.     Learned Counsel on behalf of the accused, contends that the view held\n\nby the learned trial Court on both the counts is possible and plausible view\n\nand therefore this Court ought not to interfere with the same.  Learned\nCounsel has placed reliance on State V/s Jeronio Fernandes & Ors. (2006\n(1) Bom. C.R. (Cri.) 109) and Lakhpatraj Samparaj Jain V/s State of\nMaharashtra & Ors. (2007 (1) Bom. C.R. (Cri.) 499).  In the first case it has\n\nbeen held that while exercising its jurisdiction under Section 378 Cri.P.C. the\n\nHigh Court should not substitute  its own view for the view taken by the trial\n\nCourt and in case two views are possible, then ordinarily the view taken by\n\nthe trial Court should not be disturbed.  In the second case it was held that\n\nnon-service of notice was certainly a possible view which could have been\n\ntaken on the basis of material on record.  On those facts this Court had\n\nrefused to grant to leave to appeal.\n\n13.     As far as the appellate powers of this Court are concerned, the law is\n\nwell settled.  The appellate powers of this Court against an order of acquittal\n\nare no different from the powers against an order of conviction.  This Court\n\nhas full powers to review at large the evidence upon which the order of                                              7\n\nacquittal is founded and to reach the conclusion that upon that evidence, the\n\norder of acquittal should be reversed.  It should only bear in mind the initial\n\npresumption of innocence is fortified by the acquittal and not weakened and\n\nif two conclusions are possible based on the evidence produced, then the\n\nCourt will decline to interfere but in case the view taken by the trial Court is\n\nunreasonable or the judgment is manifestly erroneous then it is the bounden\n\nduty of this Court to set the acquittal aside.  It is well to remember that the\n\nparamount consideration of the Court is to ensure that justice is done and\n\nmiscarriage of justice is prevented.  Acquittal of the guilty and conviction of\nthe innocent are both to be avoided.  As observed by the Apex Court in State\nof Himachal Pradesh V/s Lekh Raj & Anr. (AIR 1999 SC 3916), the Courts\n\nare required to replace the traditional dogmatic hypertechnical approach by\n\nrational, realistic and genuine approach for administering justice in a criminal\n\ntrial.\n\n14.     The conclusions arrived at by the learned trial Court on the basis of\n\nevidence produced are highly unreasonable and therefore are required to be\n\ndisturbed.\n\n15.     Admittedly, the Complainant had received as on 13/11/2002 Rs.\n\n45,000/- i.e. more amount than due on the subject cheque and yet the learned\n\nJMFC proceeded to frame substance of accusation on 23/07/2003.  One                                              8\n\nwould wonder as to why the learned Magistrate proceeded to frame the\n\nsubstance of accusation against the accused in case by that date the payment\n\ndue on the subject cheque was made to the Complainant.  This aspect seems\n\nto have been completely lost sight of by the learned Magistrate who even\n\nmade some uncharitable remarks against the Complainant that he had filed\n\nthe complaint only with the intention of grabbing extra amount for which he\nwas not entitled to.  As held by this Court in William Rosario Fernandes V/s\nCabral & Co. & Ors. (2007 (1) Bom. C.R. (Cri.) 141) the offence under\n\nSection 138 of the Act is completed in all respects upon the failure by the\n\naccused to comply with the notice of demand.  If payment is made within the\n\nsaid period of notice, then no offence is committed but in case of failure, the\n\noffence is completed.  Even if the payment is made on the 16th day the same\n\nis not sufficient to come out of the rigours of Section 138 of the Act.  In\n\nCriminal law commission of offence is one thing and prosecution for it is\nquite another.  Referring to Rajneesh Aggarwal V/s Amit J. Bhalla (2001 (5)\nBom. C.R.(S.C.) 162):(AIR 2001 SC 518), it was stated that so far as the\n\ncriminal complaint is concerned, once the offence is committed, any payment\n\nmade subsequent thereof, will not absolve the accused of the liability of the\n\ncriminal offence, though in the matter of awarding of sentence, it may have\n\nsome effect on the Court trying the offence.  The Supreme Court in the\n\naforesaid case has stated that the object of issuing notice indicating the\n\nfactum of dishonour of cheques, is to give an opportunity to the drawer to                                              9\n\nmake payment within 15 days, so that it will not be necessary for the payee to\n\nproceed against in any criminal action, even though the Bank dishonoured the\n\ncheques.  Relying on the said decision this Court held that once the offence is\n\ncommitted, any payment made subsequent thereto, will not absolve the\n\naccused of the liability of criminal offence, though in the matter of awarding\n\nof sentence, it may have some effect on the Court trying the offence.  It is\n\ntherefore obvious that the accused could not have been acquitted under\n\nSection 138 of the Act only because the payments were made subsequently\n\nand therefore the acquittal of the accused has got to be considered as perverse\n\nand illegal in the light of the decision of the Apex Court, as followed by this\nCourt in the said case of  William Rosario Fernandes (supra).\n\n16.     Coming to the service of notice which is sine qua non for launching a\n\nprosecution under Section 138 of the Act, Counsel on behalf of the accused\n\nsubmits, that the said notice was sent to three different persons and when it\n\nwas returned with postal endorsement as 'refused' it could not be attributed\n\nthat it is the accused who had refused the same.  Admittedly, a copy of the\n\nnotice produced by the Complainant shows that the statutory notice dated\n\n17/12/2001 was addressed to three different persons or entities, namely, the\n\naccused Mr. Narayan R. Bandekar, the Managing Director of M/s. Rajaram\n\nBandekar (Sirigao) Mines Pvt. Ltd. and to the said Company/A2 and the\n\nfirm/A3 but the Complainant had enclosed the said notices in one envelope                                              10\n\nand the said returned envelope shows that it was addressed thus:\n\n                Mr. Narayan R. Bandekar\n                Managing Director,\n                M/s. Rajaram Bandekar (Sirigao) Mines P. Ltd.\n                M/s. Anant V. Sarmalkar\n                Nitin Chamber, Swatantra Path,\n                Vasco-da-Gama.\n\n17.     The said notice, as per the postal endorsement was returned as\n\n\u201crefused, return to sender\u201d.  The Complainant admitted that the said legal\n\nnotice was enclosed in one envelope and was jointly addressed to all the\n\naccused and that he had not sent separate notices in separate envelopes.  He\n\ndenied the suggestion that the said notice was not issued in the name of the\n\naccused Narayan Bandekar in his personal capacity.  The accused in his\n\nstatement recorded under Section 313 of the Code denied that he had\n\nreceived the legal notice from the Complainant.  In my view, the manner the\n\nComplainant had addressed the said notice, which address has been\n\nreproduced herein above, clearly shows that it was sent to the accused\n\ndescribing him as Managing Director of the said company and the said firm\n\nand when it was returned by the postman as refused, it is deemed to have\n\nbeen refused by the accused Narayan R. Bandekar and in such a situation I\n\nam not inclined to accept the submission of the learned Counsel on behalf of\n\nthe accused, that the notice was sent to three persons and that no notice was\n\nserved to the accused as required under Section 138 of the Act.  The notice\n\nwas duly served to the accused and in terms of Section 27 of the General                                              11\n\nClauses Act, there is a presumption that it was served, the presumption which\n\ncould not be rebutted by the said accused by his mere denial in his statement\n\nunder Section 313 of the Code.  Refusal to accept has always been considered\n\nas good service.\n\n18.     Admittedly, the subject cheque was issued by the accused from his\n\npersonal account and this has been admitted by the Complainant in his\n\nevidence.  The Complainant has also admitted that he had received the said\n\ncheque from the accused in his personal capacity and had further stated in his\n\ncross-examination that he did not know why the accused had issued the\n\nsubject cheque in his personal capacity and that he was aware that the\n\naccused was not owing any amount to him in his personal capacity.\n\nNevertheless, the Complainant had stated in his affidavit in evidence that the\n\nsubject cheque was issued for and on behalf of accused nos. 2 and 3.  In this\n\ncontext learned Counsel on behalf of the accused, has placed reliance on an\nex-parte judgment of this Court in the case of Hiten Sagar & Anr. V/s IMC\nLtd. & Anr. (2001 (5) Bom. C.R. 890) wherein this Court observed that it is\n\nwell settled principle of criminal law that a penal provision of a Statute has to\n\nbe strictly construed and if in a wider connotation it will amount\n\ndisadvantage to the accused, such wider connotation cannot be accepted.  On\n\na reading of Section 138 of the Act, it is clearly spelt out that a cheque must\n\nbe drawn for discharge of the liability of the drawer of the cheque.  In other                                              12\n\nwords, if he has drawn a cheque for the discharge of the liability of another\n\nperson without creating any document, it will not and it would not come\n\nunder Section 138 of the Act.  This judgment of this Court came for\n\nconsideration before this Court in an unreported judgment dated 31/08/2007\nin Criminal Revision Application No. 6/2007 in the case of Mr. Diago\nFernandes V/s Mr. P.K. Vijayan & Anr. and in distinguishing the said\n\njudgment this Court observed thus:\n\n                \u201cSecondly, the said judgment has got to be considered as\n        per incurrium in that it does not take into consideration the\n        provisions of Section 139 of the Act as the aforesaid provision\n        was not brought to its notice and it was also not in tune with the\n        observations of the Apex Court in I.C.D.S. Ltd. V/s Beemna\n        Shabeer & Anr. (2002 (4) ALL M.R. 270 (S.C.)) wherein the\n        Apex Court had stated that the legislature has been careful enough\n        to record not only discharge in whole or in part of any debt but the\n        same includes other liability as well (emphasis supplied).\u201d\n\nThis court after taking into account some views expressed by other High\n\nCourts held as follows:\n\n                \u201cSection 138 of the Act deals with a cheque drawn by a\n        person \u201cfor the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or\n        other liability\u201d.  The section does not say that the cheque should\n        have been drawn for the discharge of any debt or other liability of\n        the drawer towards the payee.  If the intention of the Parliament\n        was otherwise the words \u201cof any debt or other liability\u201d would\n        have been further qualified by adding the words \u201cof the drawer\u201d.\n        Section 139 of the Act which creates a mandatory legal\n        presumption again uses the words \u201cfor the discharge, in whole or\n        in part, of any debt or other liability\u201d which only means that the\n        debt or other liability may be due from any person and it is not\n        necessary that the debt or other liability should be due from the\n        drawer alone.  In other words, the expression \u201cany debt or other\n        liability\u201d both in Section 138 as well as in Section 139 of the Act\n        would include a cheque drawn by one person towards a legal\n        enforceable debt or liability of another person.\u201d                                              13\n\n19.     When the Complainant stated that the accused had issued the subject\n\ncheque on behalf of accused nos. 2 and 3 all that the Complainant sought to\n\nconvey was that the subject cheque was issued by the accused to meet the\n\nliabilities of accused nos. 2 and 3 who owed to the Complainant the said\n\nsums under the said award of the Industrial Tribunal and in such a case also\n\nthe Complainant was entitled to the presumption available to the\n\nComplainant  in  terms of both  Section 138 as well as Section 139 of the Act\n\nwhich are mandatory in nature and admit of no exception though the same\n\ncan be rebutted by the accused either by giving evidence of his own or\n\ngetting evidence in his favour from the Complainant, to displace the said\n\npresumption.  The accused was nothing but an alter ego of the Company/A2\n\nand the firm/A3 whose Managing Director/partner he was and had even paid\n\na sum of Rs. 60,000/- to the Complainant, regarding which there was no\n\ndenial.  Therefore the contention that the accused had issued the cheque\n\nwithout consideration cannot be accepted.  The Complainant had abundantly\n\nproved that the accused had issued the cheque to meet the liability of A2 and\n\nA3 whose Managing Director/partner he was.\n\n20.     Learned Counsel on behalf of the accused next refers to Section 43 of\n\nthe Act and submits that there was no obligation created between the parties.\n\nSection 43 provides that the negotiable instrument made, drawn, accepted,\n\nindorsed, or transferred without consideration, or for a consideration which                                              14\n\nfails, creates no obligation of payment between the parties to the transaction.\n\nBut if any such party had transferred the instrument with or without\n\nindorsement to a holder for consideration, such holder, and every subsequent\n\nholder deriving title from him, may recover the amount due on such\n\ninstrument from the  transferor for consideration or any prior party thereto.  It\n\nis not necessary to refer to the exceptions to the said section.  The\n\nComplainant in this case had stated that even  settlement before the Industrial\n\nTribunal was signed by the accused as Managing Director of accused nos 2\n\nand 3 and thereafter had issued the subject cheque on behalf of accused nos. 2\n\nand 3.  In view of my finding that the cheque was issued by the accused to\n\nmeet the liabilities of A2 and A3 under the award it is not necessary to dilate\n\nfurther on the provision of Section 43 of the Act, which is clearly\n\ninapplicable to the facts of the case.\n\n21.     The accused had also failed to prove that he stood as surety by issuing\n\nthe said cheque.  It was not just enough for the accused to have stated so but\n\nit was necessary to prove the same by preponderance of probabilities.  Such a\n\nplea was not put forward to the Complainant and it was taken as an\n\nafterthought.\n\n22.     In the light of the above discussion, the accused could not have\n\nescaped his conviction under Section 138 of the Act.  As a result, the appeal                                              15\n\ndeserves to succeed and the acquittal of the accused reversed.  The accused is\n\ntherefore hereby convicted under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments\n\nAct, 1881.\n\n23.     Admittedly, the Complainant received Rs. 45,000/- from A2 on\n\n13/11/2002 and Rs. 60,000/- from the accused later.  On behalf of the\n\naccused an application has been filed for compounding the offence under\n\nSection 138 of the Act which has now been made compoundable under\n\nSection 147 of the Act.  Counsel appearing on behalf of the accused submits\n\nthat the Complainant is not inclined to enter into any compromise with the\n\naccused.  The said application dated 23/10/2007 filed on behalf of the\n\nComplainant today shall be placed on record and marked 'X' for\n\nidentification.  Lot of averments have been made in the said application\n\nstating that Complainant earlier had assured the accused to withdraw the\n\ncomplaint.  The accused has also stated in the said application that he had\n\nthen offered to the Complainant a sum of Rs. 15,000/- to put an end to the\n\nmatter but the Complainant is out to extort more money from the said\n\naccused.  It is not necessary to get into all that is stated in the said application\n\nfiled by the accused today except to say that the Complainant is not willing to\n\ncompound the offence and he cannot be forced to enter into a compromise.\n\nLearned Counsel on behalf of the accused has placed reliance on the\njudgment of this Court in the case of Tempo Instruments & Equipments                                              16\n(India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. V/s. Padmavati Jugal Kishore Mehta & Ors. (2007\n(2) Bom. C.R. (Cri.) 626) and has submitted that compounding could be\n\nrecorded by this Court irrespective of whether the Complainant is willing or\n\nnot.  As per learned Advocate the concept of compounding under Section 147\n\nof the Act is different from Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n\n1973.  Counsel on behalf of the Complainant submits that no principle of law\n\nhas been laid down in the said judgment of this Court relied upon on behalf\nof the  accused and reported in Tempo Instruments & Equipments (India)\nPvt. Ltd.(supra) and I am inclined to accept the said submission.  In that case,\n\napplication for compounding which was opposed by the Complainant before\n\nthe trial Court was granted by the learned Single Judge.\n\n24.     The expression \u201cCompounding\u201d in terms of  Black's Law Dictionary\nmeans to compromise; to effect a composition with a creditor; to obtain\ndischarge from a debt by the payment of a smaller sum.  To put together as\nelements, ingredients, or parts, to form a whole; to combine, to unite.  To\nform or make up as a composite product by combining different elements,\ningredients, or parts, as to combine a medicine.                          The expression\n\u201cCompounding crime\u201d is also defined in the same dictionary and it states\nthat Compounding crime consists of the receipt of some property or other\nconsideration in return for an agreement not to prosecute or inform on one\nwho has committed a crime.  There are three elements to this offence at                                              17\n\ncommon law, and under the typical compounding statute:\n            (1) the agreement not to prosecute;\n            (2) knowledge of the actual commission of a crime; and\n            (3) the receipt of some consideration.\n\n25.     Compounding essentially involves a compromise or agreement and\n\nthere cannot be a one way traffic whilst entering into a compromise and that\n\nwould be both for the purpose of Section 147 of the Act as well as Section\n\n320 of the Code.  If the Complainant is not willing to accept a compromise,\n\nthe same cannot be imposed upon him by the Court and the matter will have\n\nto be dealt with in accordance with law.  Application filed by the accused,\n\ntherefore needs to be rejected.\n\n26.     Learned Counsel on behalf of the accused has also brought to my\nnotice the judgment of this Court in this case of said William Rosario\nFernandes (supra) wherein fine of Rs. 5,000/- was imposed.  He has also\nbrought to my notice the judgment of the Apex Court in Narsingh Das\nTapadia V/s Goverdhan Das Partani & Anr. (AIR 2000 SC 2946) wherein\n\nthe Apex Court substituted the sentence by imposing a fine of Rs. 5,000/- to\n\nbe deposited within two months.                 Learned Counsel on behalf of the\n\nComplainant has left the matter as regards fine to be imposed to the\n\ndiscretion of this Court.                                              18\n\n27.     Facts of every case cannot be similar.  Though no formula of a fool-\n\nproof nature is possible to be laid down in awarding appropriate sentences\n\nthey should be proportionate to the crime committed and the same should be\n\nawarded by taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each\n\ncase.  It is not only the rights of the criminals which are required to be looked\n\ninto at the time of imposition of sentence, but also of the victims of the crime\n\nand the society at large, also by considering the object sought to be achieved\n\nby the particular legislation.  Sentence to be imposed should also have a\n\ndeterrent effect.  As George Saville would say 'men are not hanged for\n\nstealing horses but that horses may not be stolen.'\n\n28.     Here is a case where the complainant, an employee, has been fighting\n\nfor his right against his employers' might for a very long time from\n\n10/06/1991.       The Complainant was then compelled to initiate criminal\n\nproceedings and being so the matter cannot be treated lightly.  Since the\n\npayment due on the cheque was made subsequently the accused is hereby\n\ndirected to pay compensation of Rs. 20,000/- to the Complainant and in\n\ndefault to undergo SI for 3 months.\n\n29.     The accused to deposit the said compensation before the trial Court\n\nwithin three weeks.           In case the accused fails to deposit the said\n\ncompensation, the learned Magistrate shall execute the sentence hereby                                              19\n\nimposed.\n\n                                                          N.A. BRITTO, J.\n\nNH/-"

Present petition under Article 227 of the Constitution\nof India, read with section 482 of the                               Code of Criminal\nProcedure, has been preferred by the                              petitioners herein \u2013\noriginal accused to quash and set aside the impugned orderSCR.A/90/2008                                 2/15                                       JUDGMENT\n\npassed by the learned  Additional Sessions Judge, Court No.10,\nAhmedabad, dtd.11/7/2007 in Criminal Revision Application\nNo.473 of 2006  as well as order dtd.16/11/2006 passed by the\nlearned  Metropolitan Magistrate, Court No.21, Ahmedabad in\nCriminal Case No. 4960 of 2006 and consequently to discharge\nthe petitioners   from Criminal Case No. 4960  of 2006 pending\nin the court of learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Court No.21,\nAhmedabad. At the outset, it is  required to be noted that\ninitially the petitioners               challenged vires of section 138 of\nNegotiable Instruments Act, 1881  as ultra vires to Articles 14,\n19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. However, subsequently\nthe petitioners               have not pressed challenge to vires of\nprovisions of section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and\ntherefore, this Court is required to deal with the petitioners'\nprayer for quashing the proceedings against the petitioners\nand for connected prayers referred to hereinabove.\n\n2.00.           That       the      respondent           No.1      herein        \u2013    original\ncomplainant has filed the impugned complaint being Criminal\nCase No. 4322 of 1995 against the                              petitioners \u2013 original\naccused in the court of                   learned          Metropolitan Magistrate,\nAhmedabad            for the offence              under section               138 of the\nNegotiable Instruments Act for dishonour of cheque bearing\n839096 dtd.5/8/2005 for an amount of Rs.68,76,551.48 ps.\nissued  by the petitioner  Nos.1 and 3 drawn  on Tamilnadu\nMercantile Bank Limited. That the petitioner  No.2 herein is\njoined as accused as partner of the petitioner  No.1 \u2013 original\naccused No.1 Partnership firm who has issued the cheque. That\nthe learned trial court directed to issue Summons upon the\npetitioners - original accused for the offence under section  138\nof the Negotiable Instruments Act. It appears that initially, theSCR.A/90/2008                                 3/15                                       JUDGMENT\n\npetitioners   preferred Special Criminal Application No.353 of\n2006 for quashing and setting aside the impugned complaint,\nhowever, the learned                   Single Judge disposed of the said\nSpecial Criminal Application  as withdrawn with a liberty in\nfavour of the petitioners   to raise all contentions and defences\nbefore the learned trial court which has issued the process.\n\n                It appears that thereafter the petitioners   submitted\nan application before the concerned Magistrate to discharge\nthem and/or to drop the proceedings mainly on the ground that\nthe cheque was taken by the complainant way of security and\na false complaint has been filed  as  there was no legal  debt or\nliability  of the accused at the time when the cheque was\nissued. That the proceedings before the DRT were pending.

That the\nlearned trial court by order dtd.16/11/2006 dismissed the said\napplication submitted by the petitioners   to discharge them by\nholding that once process has been issued, he has no\njurisdiction and/or authority to discharge the accused. Feeling\ndissatisfied with the said order passed by the learned trial\ncourt  in dismissing the discharge application submitted by the\npetitioners   - the original accused, the petitioners   - original\naccused preferred Criminal Revision Application No. 473 of\n2006 before the learned  City Sessions Court, Ahmedabad and\nthe learned            Additional City Sessions Judge, Court No.10,\nAhmedabad             by      the      impugned            judgement           and       order\ndtd.11/7/2007           has      dismissed         the     said      Criminal        RevisionSCR.A/90/2008                                 4/15                                       JUDGMENT\n\nApplication  confirming the order passed by the learned trial\ncourt dismissing the discharge application submitted by the\npetitioners        - original accused.

So far as the contention on behalf of the\npetitioners   that it was a blank signed cheque and therefore, it\nwas an incomplete bill of exchange / cheque and therefore, the\ncomplaint under section  138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act\nis not maintainable is concerned, it is submitted by Mr.Tarun\nShah, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the original\ncomplainant that when signature on the cheque is admittedSCR.A/90/2008                                 7/15                                       JUDGMENT\n\nand even the issuance of the cheque is also admitted, so far as\npayee and/or holder in due course of the cheque, there is an\nimplied authority in favour of the original complainant to fill  in\nthe blanks and  in support of the said submission, he has relied\nupon the decision of the learned  Single Judge of this Court in\nthe     case      of    Hitenbhai           Parekh,         Proprietor           \u2013   Parekh\nEnterprises, reported in 2009 (3)  G.L.H.  742  as well as\nrecent decision of this Court rendered in Special Criminal\nApplication No. 1749 of 2011; decision of the Patna High Court\nin the case of Bhagwati Prasad Bhagat and others Versus\nMt.

Now, so far as the contention on behalf of the\npetitioners           that as there are no specific averments and\nallegations in the complaint against the petitioner  Nos.2 and 3\nthat they were in day-to-day management and affairs of the\noriginal accused No.1 Partnership Firm and therefore, they\ncannot be held vicariously liable under section  141 of the\nNegotiable Instruments Act and for that reliance placed upon\nthe decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court  in the case of\nSudhir Kumar Bhalla (supra), it is submitted by Mr.T.V. Shah,\nlearned       advocate          appearing          on     behalf       of     the     original\ncomplainant that whatever the observations are made by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court, they are   with respect to the offence\nby the Company and the vicarious liability of the Directors of\nthe Company, may not be applicable to the offence committed\nby the Partnership Firm and its partners. It is submitted that\nthere is distinction between a Director of the Company and a\nPartner of the Partnership Firm. It is submitted that under the\nprovisions of the Partnership Act, for any act and/or omission\non the part of the Partnership Firm, all the partners of the\nPartnership Firm are jointly liable and therefore, when the\nliability of the Partners is under the statute \u2013 Partnership Act,\nthere need not be any specific averments in the complaint that\nthe said partner was in day-to-day affairs and management of\nthe Partnership Firm. Therefore, it is submitted that when the\naccused Nos.2 and 3 are Partners of the original accused No.1SCR.A/90/2008                                 10/15                                      JUDGMENT\n\nPartnership Firm and they are statutorily liable for the acts of\nthe Partnership Firm, the impugned complaint is not required to\nbe  quashed and set aside in exercise of the powers under\nSection 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  It is further\nsubmitted that even otherwise, so far as the petitioner  No.3 \u2013\noriginal accused No.3 is concerned, he is Partner who has\nissued the cheque and therefore, on the aforesaid ground, the\nimpugned complaint is not required to be quashed and set\naside so far as the petitioner  No.3 \u2013 original accused No.3 is\nconcerned.\n\n        By making above submissions and relying upon the above\ndecisions, it is requested to dismiss the present petition.\n\n5.00.           Heard the learned advocates appearing on behalf of\nthe  respective  parties at length.\n\n5.01.                    At the outset, it is required to be noted that\nthe impugned complaint / criminal proceedings are initiated\nagainst the petitioners   for the offence under section  138 of\nthe Negotiable Instruments Act  and the same are sought to be\nquashed and set aside mainly on the ground that at the\nrelevant time when the cheque in question was given to the\ncomplainant, it was a blank signed cheque  given for security /\ncollateral security and therefore, it was an incomplete Bill of\nExchange / cheque and therefore, for dishonour of the said\nincomplete Bill of Exchange / Cheque, complaint under section\n138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is not maintainable and\nalso on the ground that there are  no specific averments and\nallegations in the complaint that the petitioner  Nos.2 and 3\nwere in day-to-day affairs and management of the originalSCR.A/90/2008                                 11/15                                      JUDGMENT\n\naccused No.1 Partnership Firm.\n\n5.02.           Now, so far as the contention on behalf of the\npetitioners that at the time when the cheque was given it was\nan incomplete cheque and it was a blank signed cheque  and\nat that time when the cheque was issued, there was no legal\ndebt or liability are concerned, it is required to be noted that\nwhat is required to be considered is debt or liability at the time\nwhen the cheque was deposited. Once signature on the cheque\nis admitted and even issuance of the cheque is also admitted\nby the petitioners  - accused, in that case, as held by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court  in the case of Hitenbhai Parekh,\nProprietor           \u2013    Parekh         Enterprise,           (supra)        as     well     as\nunreported decision                  of this Court rendered in                       Special\nCriminal Application No.1749 of 2011, payee or holder in\ndue course has  an implied authority to fill in the blanks and\nparticulars.        At this stage even sections 6 and                            20 of the\nNegotiable Instruments Act are also required to be referred to\nand considered, which give an authority to payee and/or holder\nin due course of the Negotiable Instruments to fill in the blanks\nand/or make the instrument complete.\n\n5.03.           In the case of             Hitenbhai Parekh, Proprietor \u2013\nParekh Enterprises (supra) as well as in unreported decision\nof this Court in Special Criminal Application No.1749 of 2011,  it\nis observed and held by this Court that it will always be open\nfor the holder of the cheque to fill in the blanks in his own\nhandwriting and there is an implied authority for the person\nreceiving such cheque to complete it by filling blanks.  It is\nfurther observed and held that when a cheque has been issued\nand signed by the party, there is always a presumption withSCR.A/90/2008                                 12/15                                      JUDGMENT\n\nrespect to legal debt as per Section 139 of the Negotiable\nInstruments Act, 1881. Of course, the same is rebuttable by\nleading evidence that at the relevant time when the cheque\nwas deposited, there was no debt for the amount for which the\ncheque was issued.\n\n                Under the circumstances, the contention on behalf\nof the petitioners                that at the time when the cheque in\nquestion was given it was incomplete cheque and therefore, for\ndishonour of the said cheque                        under section              138 of the\nNegotiable Instruments Act                    is not maintainable, cannot be\naccepted, however,  the same can be only at the time of trial\nand on leading the evidence.\n\n5.04.           Now, so far as the contention on behalf of the\npetitioners that the cheque was given by way of collateral\nsecurity / security and at the time when the cheque was given\nthere was no legal debt or liability                              and therefore, the\nimpugned complaint deserves to be quashed and set aside, is\nconcerned, it is required to be noted that  there is statutory\npresumption of legal debt or liability is rebuttable                                    under\nsections        139 and 118 of the                  Negotiable Instruments Act,\nhowever, the same is rebuttable at the time of trial.   Under the\ncircumstances,            on     the      aforesaid        ground         the     impugned\ncomplaint / criminal proceedings are not required to be\nquashed and set aside in exercise of powers under Article\n226/227 of the Constitution of India read with section 482 of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n5.05.           In the case of Balbhadurasinh Indrasinhji Zala\n(supra) the Hon'ble Supreme Court  has specifically observedSCR.A/90/2008                                 13/15                                      JUDGMENT\n\nand held that only because the cheque was given as collateral\nsecurity it would not lack consideration and therefore, section\n138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act would be applicable.\nDifferent       High      Courts       in    different       decisions,        referred       to\nhereinabove, have taken similar view  that on the ground that\nbank cheque was drawn in favour of the complainant as\nsecurity and the said cheque has been dishonoured, complaint\nunder      section          138      would       be     maintainable.           Under       the\ncircumstances, on the aforesaid ground, the impugned criminal\nproceedings  are not required to be quashed and set aside.\n\n5.06.           Now, so far as the contention on behalf of the\npetitioner Nos.2 and 3 that as there are no specific averments\nand allegations in the complaint that the accused Nos.2 and 3\nwere in day-to-day affairs and management of the accused\nNo.1 Partnership Firm and therefore, they cannot be held\nvicariously liable            under section                141 of the            Negotiable\nInstruments Act is concerned, it is required to be noted that so\nfar as the accused No.3 is concerned, he has issued cheque for\nand on behalf of the original accused No.1  Partnership Firm.\nUnder the circumstances, when the accused No.3 has issued\nthe cheque in question, there  need not be any averments and\nallegations in the complaint that  he was in day-to-day affairs\nand management of the original accused No.1 Partnership Firm.\n\n5.07.           So     far     as     the     petitioner        No.2       is    concerned,\nconsidering the averments and allegations  in the complaint as\nthere are no specific averments and allegations in the\ncomplaint that the petitioner  No.2 \u2013 original accused No.2 was\nin day-to-day management and affairs of the original accused\nNo.1 Partnership Firm and therefore, his case deserves to beSCR.A/90/2008                                 14/15                                      JUDGMENT\n\nconsidered in light of the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt  in the case of Sudhir Kumar Bhalla (supra) as well as\nin the case of Katta Sujatha (SMT) (supra).\n\n5.08.           Mr.T.V. Shah, learned advocate appearing on behalf\nof the original complainant has tried to distinguish the case of\nthe Directors of the Company and Partners of the Partnership\nFirm by submitting that under the Partnership Act all partners\nare statutorily liable for the acts of Partnership Firm.

Heard both sides.\n\t3. The facts giving rise to filing of this revision petition as stood exposited from the records could succinctly and precisely, pithily and briefly be set out thus:\n\tThe respondent herein filed the suit O.S.No.2484 of 2004 in City Civil Court, Chennai as against the revision petitioner herein, seeking the following reliefs:\n\t\"a) For a declaration that the cheque bearing No.481262 dated 31.5.2004 drawn on the Oriental Bank of Commerce, T.Nagar Branch was obtained from the plaintiff by using undue influence, coercion and fraud and thereby      ab initio void and invalid;\n\tb) Directing the defendant to pay the cost of the suit to the plaintiff.\"\t\n\t\n\t4. It appears that the trial commenced and evidence was let in on the side of the plaintiff.  While the plaintiff attempted to mark the photocopy of a letter, the revision petitioner/defendant herein objected to the marking, whereupon the trial Court also recording the objection did not permit the plaintiff to mark such photocopy of the letter.  Thereafter I.A.No.7247 of 2007 was filed praying the Court to refer the copy of the letter purported to contain the signature of the revision petitioner herein so as to compare the same with the signatures of the defendant in the Vakalat and the written statement.  The lower Court allowed it vide the order dated 03.03.2008.\n\n\t5. Animadverting such allowing of the petition, this revision is focussed on various grounds.\n\t\n\t6. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner placing reliance on the grounds of revision would develop his argument to the effect that the photocopy of the letter is an unauthentic one and the trial Court should not have placed reliance on the same and ordered such a letter to be sent to the expert for comparing the disputed signature with that of the admitted signatures in the Vakalat and written statement before the lower Court; the said I.A. and the suit were filed purely for the purpose of dragging on the proceedings in C.C.No.7112 of 2004 initiated by the revision petitioner herein under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.\n\t\n\t7. At this juncture I would like to highlight the common or garden principle of law that unauthentic document cannot be the basis for any decision.  Here the impugned letter is a photocopy.  The defendant objected even at the time of marking, whereupon the said document was not marked and in such a case, I am at a loss to understand as to how the trial Court simply could have found any reason in sending the same unauthenticated and unproved document to the expert for comparison.  There is also nothing to indicate that in the photocopy there is any endorsement that it is a true copy of the original letter, which is purported to be available with the revision petitioner.  However the revision petitioner would deny and refute such execution of letter and also the availability of such letter in his possession.  It is a matter of evidence before the lower Court and it is for the plaintiff to prove his case.\n\n\t8. I would also like to point out that whenever a party's signature is sent to the expert for opinion, he should secure before the Court anti litum motem signature/handwriting and comparison could be effectively be made with those anti litum motem signature/handwriting.  But in this case, the plaintiff without taking any such steps, simply tried his level best to place reliance on the signature found in the Vakalat as well as the written statement.  \n\t\n\t9. Above all, I would like to reiterate without being tautologous that unless there is some authenticity about the copy of the letter which is sought to be sent for handwriting expert, there is no question of sending the same for comparison.  \n\n\t10. Hence in this view of the matter, I am of the opinion that the ratiocination adhered to by the lower Court is not sound and accordingly the order of the lower Court is set aside.  While holding so, I make it clear that it is for the plaintiff to prove his case before the Court and it is for the Court to evaluate the evidence untrammelled and uninfluenced by any of observations made by this Court in this order.\n\n\tAccordingly, this civil revision petition is allowed.  No costs.  Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.\n\t\n19.01.2009\nIndex\t:Yes\nInternet:Yes\n\n\nTo\n\nXIV Assistant Judge, \nCity Civil Court,\nChennai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nG.RAJASURIA, J\n\ngms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nC.R.P.(PD)No.1466 of 2008\nand M.P.No.1 of 2008 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19.01.2009"

No. 671 of 2000 on the file of the Judicial\nMagistrate of First Class, Irinjalakuda. The appellant\nfiled the above case against the first respondent to\nprosecute him under Section 138 of the Negotiable\nInstruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter the parties are\nmentioned according to their rank in the trial court).\n        2.      The case of the complainant is that, the\naccused had drawn and delivered to the complainant\nExt.P1 cheque of Rs.50,000/- and when the cheque was\npresented for encashment at Central Bank of India,\nKodakara branch, it was dishonoured with an endorsement\n\u2018funds          insufficient\u2019.                  Though           statutory             notice          was\nissued to the accused as per the Negotiable Instruments\nAct, the accused, after accepting the notice, refused\nto pay the amount. Hence, the complainant alleged that,\nthe accused committed the offence punishable underCRL.APPEAL NO.684 OF 2005                3\nSection 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.\n        3.      To       substantiate                the       case,         the       complainant\nhimself was examined as PW1. Exhibits P1 to P6 are the\nexhibits marked on the side of the complainant. On\ngoing through the evidences and documents, the trial\ncourt found that, the accused has not committed the\noffence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments\nAct and he is acquitted under Section 255(1) of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure. Aggrieved by the acquittal\norder, this Crl.Appeal is filed.\n        4.      Heard the learned counsel for the appellant and\nthe learned counsel for the first respondent.\n        5.      The learned counsel for the appellant submitted\nthat, in the light of the evidence of PW1 and the\ndocumentary evidences produced as Exts.P1 to P6, the\ncomplainant established the execution of the cheque and\nthe accused has not adduced any evidence to rebut the\npresumption. According to the counsel, the findings of\nthe trial court are flimsy and acquittal order passed\nby the trial court will not stand in the eye of law.\nThe counsel for the first respondent submitted that,CRL.APPEAL NO.684 OF 2005                4\nthe  trial  court  considered  all  the  aspects  and\nacquitted his client. According to the counsel, there\nis nothing to interfere with the acquittal order passed\nby the trial court.\n        6.      After          hearing           both         sides,          the        point         for\nconsideration is whether the accused committed the\noffence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments\nAct ?\n        7.      To       substantiate                the       case,         the       complainant\nhimself was examined as PW1. It is a settled position\nthat, to attract the presumption under Section 139 and\n118 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, the complainant\nhas to prove the preliminary burden, ie. the execution\nof the cheque. Only if, the execution of the cheque is\nproved, the burden shifts to the accused to rebut the\npresumption.                Therefore,              the       first          question            to      be\nconsidered             is,       whether           the       complainant               proved          the\nexecution of the cheque. According to PW1, the accused\ngave the cheque to the complainant after filling up the\ncheque and putting signature in it, in front of him.\nThis         is       the        definite             evidence             adduced            by       theCRL.APPEAL NO.684 OF 2005                5\ncomplainant. In the proof affidavit, the complainant\ndeposed that, Ext.P1 cheque is brought written and it\nwas  signed  in  front  of  him.  But  in  the  cross-\nexamination,  the  case  of  the  complainant  is  very\ndefinite that, the name and the date in Ext.P1 cheque\nwas written by the accused himself and the cheque was\nissued in his residence and further that, the name,\ndate and signature were scribed by the same ink. The\ncontradiction in the cross examination of prosecution\nwitness No.1 itself creates doubt about the execution\nof the cheque. Moreover, the trial court on perusal of\nExt.P1 cheque found that, there is difference in the\nwriting in the cheque. It is also stated that, there is\ndifference in the ink used for writing the date and\namount on one side and the name of the payee and the\namount in figures on the other side. The counsel for\nthe appellant submitted that, even if a signed cheque\nis handed over by the accused to the complainant, he\nhas got a right to fill up the cheque and present\nbefore the bank. According to the counsel, if a signed\nblank cheque is handed over to the complainant, thereCRL.APPEAL NO.684 OF 2005                6\nis a presumption that, the accused is giving liberty to\nthe complainant to fill up the cheque. But in the facts\nof the present case, that principle is not applicable.\nIn this case, the complainant has no case that, a blank\nsinged cheque was issued by the accused to him. His\ncase in the chief examination is that, Ext.P1 cheque\nwas brought written and it was signed in front of him.\nIn the cross-examination, his case is that, name and\ndate in Ext.P1 cheque was written by the accused\nhimself and the cheque was issued at his residence and\nfurther that, the name, date and signature were scribed\nwith the same ink. In such circumstances, since there\nis no case to the complainant that, a signed blank\ncheque was given to him by the accused, he has no\nauthority to fill up the cheque. Hence, in the light of\nthe evidence adduced by the prosecution, it is clear\nthat, the execution of the cheque is not proved.\n        8.      Moreover,              the       trial          court          considered              the\ncontentions of the complainant in detail. The relevant\nportion of the judgment is extracted hereunder:\n                       \u201cThe complainant has also no case that the accusedCRL.APPEAL NO.684 OF 2005                7\n               has issued him a blank cheque towards the discharge of\n               the payment and as such there is no question of any\n               implied authority to fill up the relevant details.\n               Hence, I can only found that the complainant has failed\n               to prove the execution of Ext.P1 and as such he is not\n               entitled to draw the presumption under sec.118 and 139\n               of the Negotiable Instruments Act. There is every\n               reason to see that the cheque might have issued as a\n               security  for  Sri.  Saiva  Kuries.  Point  is  found\n               accordingly.\u201d\n\n        9.      I do not find any reason to interfere with the\nfinding of the trial court. This court cannot upset the\nacquittal order in an appeal against acquittal order,\nsimply because, another view is possible. In this case,\nthe trial court after considering the entire evidences\ncame into the definite conclusion of acquittal.\n        Hence, I am not in a position to interfere with the\nwell considered judgment of the trial court. Hence,\nthis appeal is dismissed confirming the judgment dated\n14.11.2003 in C.C. No.671 of 2000 on the file of the\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class, Irinjalakuda.\n                                                                           Sd/-\npkk                                                    P.V.KUNHIKRISHNAN, JUDGE"

For the sake of convenience, the appellant and the respondent will be referred to as complainant and accused respectively.  \n\n\t3. It is the case of the complainant that on 20.08.2005, the accused borrowed Rs.1,50,000/&#126; and for discharging the said liability, issued a post&#126;dated cheque dated 25.11.2005 (Ex.P1) for Rs.1,50,000/&#126; drawn on Indian Bank, Palavakkam branch; on 25.11.2005, the accused requested the complainant to deposit the cheque on 29.11.2005 and accordingly, the complainant deposited the same in Indian Bank, Arakkonam branch on 29.11.2005; however, the cheque was returned with the endorsement \u0093funds insufficient\u0094 on 27.12.2005 (Ex.P3); the complainant contacted the accused and the accused requested him to re&#126;present the cheque and accordingly, the complainant re&#126;presented the cheque on 08.02.2006;  this time also the cheque was returned unpaid with the endorsement \u0093funds insufficient\u0094 vide bank advice dated 10.02.2006 (Ex.P4); the complainant issued a statutory demand notice dated 23.02.2006 (Ex.P5), which was received by the accused on 25.02.2006 vide acknowledgment card (Ex.P6); since the accused did not comply with the demand, the complainant initiated a prosecution in C.C.No.137 of 2006 before the Judicial Magistrate, Arakkonam under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for brevity \u0093the NI Act\u0094) against the accused.\n\n\t4. On the appearance of the accused, he was questioned under Section 251 Cr.P.C. and he denied the accusation.  To prove the case, the complainant examined himself as P.W.1. and marked Ex.P1 to Ex.P6.  Guru Subramani, Assistant Manager of Indian Bank, Palavakkam branch was examined as P.W.2, where the accused was having his account and his account statement was marked as Ex.P7.\n\n\t5. When the accused was questioned under Section 313 Cr.P.C. about the incriminating circumstances appearing against him, he denied the same. No witness was examined on the side of the accused nor any document marked.\n\n\t6. After considering the evidence on record and hearing either side, the trial Court, by judgment dated 14.05.2009 in C.C.No.137 of 2006, convicted the accused of the offence under Section 138 of the NI Act and sentenced him to undergo one year simple imprisonment and fine of Rs.5,000/&#126; in default, to undergo three months simple imprisonment.  Challenging the conviction and sentence, the accused filed C.A.No.2 of 2010, which has been allowed by the Additional Sessions Court, FTC&#126;II, Ranipet on 01.07.2011, challenging which, the complainant has preferred the present appeal against acquittal.  \n\n\t7. Notice in this appeal was served on the accused on 20.02.2012 by the Judicial Magistrate, Arakkonam, despite which, he did not enter appearance.  Therefore, this Court appointed Mr.Karthik Raja, Advocate (Enrl. No.1934 of 2006) of more than 10 years of standing in the criminal side to appear for the accused.\n\n\t8. Heard Mr.Samuel Rajapandian, learned counsel for the complainant and Mr.Karthik Raja, learned counsel for the accused.  \n\n\t9. This Court perused the reasoning given by the appellate Court for acquitting the accused and it may be worthwhile to extract the same :\n\t\u0093... ... 6.  Yet, I&#45;m impressed that the complainant hasn&#45;t successfully discharged the initial burden of establishing the subsistence a legally enforceable debt on the date of issue of the cheque or earlier.  Rs.1,50,000/&#126; is a huge amount.  The complainant took no security except a post&#126;dated cheque which is Exhibit&#126;P1.  No proof of the complainant&#45;s economic position to the extent of lending Rs.1,50,000/&#126; so liberally that he bothered to take no security.  True, the burden to prove non&#126;existence of consideration is upon the accused.  For this, he need not adduce independent evidence on his side, he may even rely upon the complainant&#45;s evidence and bring on record preponderance of probabilities pointing to non&#126;existence of consideration.  Reference : Kalavalli Vs. Parthasarathy [2008(2) LW (Cri.) 1230 para (42) page (1244)].  I disbelieve the complainant&#45;s evidence that he lent Rs.1,50,000/&#126; to the accused just on a post&#126;dated cheque without any other security. ... ...\u0094 \nIt is trite that in an appeal against acquittal, when two views are possible, the view that favours the case of the accused merits acceptance and the acquittal should not be easily disturbed, as held in Arulvelu and another Vs State and another [(2009)10 SCC 206].  The relevant portion of which reads as under :\n\t\u009334. ...\n\t(1) ... \n\t(2) ...\n\t(3) ...\n\t(4) ...\n\t(5) If two reasonable or possible views can be reached &#126; one that leads to acquittal, the other to conviction &#126; the High Courts/appellate courts must rule in favour of the accused.\u0094\n\n\t10. This Court carefully perused the evidence of the complainant (P.W.1).  The complainant (P.W.1), in his evidence, has stated that, the accused had borrowed Rs.1,50,000/&#126; on 20.08.2005 and gave a post&#126;dated cheque dated 25.11.2005 drawn on Indian Bank, Palavakkam branch for Rs.1,50,000/&#126;;  however, on 25.11.2005, the accused called him and told not to present the cheque and requested him to present it on 29.11.2005; accordingly, he presented the cheque on 29.11.2005; but, it was returned unpaid; again at the request of the accused, he re&#126;presented the cheque on 08.02.2006 vide bank challan (Ex.P2) and the cheque was dishonoured on 10.02.2006 on the ground \u0093funds insufficient\u0094 vide bank memo (Ex.P4); the statutory demand notice dated 23.02.2006 (Ex.P5) was issued and the same was received by the accused on 25.02.2006 vide acknowledgment card (Ex.P6).  \n\t11. In the cross&#126;examination, the complainant (P.W.1) has stated that, he know the accused for about five years and that, earlier he had taken some loans and had returned it promptly and that is the reason, he gave Rs.1,50,000/&#126; without taking anything in writing from the accused, except the post&#126;dated cheque.  It may be relevant to state here that, this answer was elicited by the defence in the cross&#126;examination.  The defence has not disputed the signature in the impugned cheque.\n\n\t12. In fact, in the cross&#126;examination, the complainant (P.W.1) has stated that, the accused himself has filled the cheque, signed and given to him on the day of borrowal.  Ultimately, it was suggested to the accused that, the brother of the complainant is running an automobile finance concern and the cheque was given to him and the same has been misused, which suggestion, the complainant has denied.  \n\n\t13. Apart from merely suggesting to the complainant, the accused had not produced any credible material, in support of the defence taken by him.  On the contrary, the complainant has examined the Manager of the bank, in which, the accused was having his account and his statement of account was marked as Ex.P7.  In Krishna Janardhan Bhat Vs. Dattatraya G. Hegde [(2008) 4 SCC 54], the Supreme Court held that albeit Section 139 of the NI Act, the complainant should prove the debt satisfactorily.  This legal position was specifically overruled by a Three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Rangappa Vs. Sri Mohan [(2010) 11 SCC 441], wherein, it is held that it is not necessary for the complainant to prove the debt to the hilt, for, that would make Section 139 of the NI Act otiose.  However, the Supreme Court has held that presumption under Section 139 of the NI Act can be discharged by the accused by preponderance of probability and not by proof beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n\t14. This Court perused the Section 313 Cr.P.C. statement of the accused and found that, he has not even given any satisfactory explanation as to how, the cheque executed and signed by him, came into the hands of the complainant.  Thus, in the teeth of the evidence adduced by the complainant and in the light of the presumption under Section 139 of the NI Act, the reasons given by the appellate Court, acquitting the accused cannot be sustained.\n\n\tIn the result, this appeal is allowed and the conviction and sentence imposed by the trial Court stands restored.  The trial Court is directed to secure the appellant and commit him to prison to undergo the remaining period of sentence, if any.\n\n25.09.2019\ngya\n\nP.N.

The aforesaid cases are instituted upon the complaint\n\nfiled against the petitioner by the first respondent for an offence\n\npunishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,\n\n1881.  The two cases are being tried jointly.\n\n        3.      When the aforesaid cases reached the stage of final\n\nhearing, the first respondent/complainant filed an application as\n\nCrl.M.P.No.10421/2019 in the trial court under Section 311 of the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as 'the\n\nCode') for reopening the evidence in the cases and to issue\n\nsummons to two witnesses for giving evidence and also forCrl.M.C.No.279/2020                                                  3\n\nproduction of documents.\n\n           4.         Inspite              of       vehement                   objection                raised            by         the\n\npetitioner/accused,                          the         trial         court           allowed              the         aforesaid\n\napplication as per Annexure-A4 order.  The trial court allowed the\n\naforesaid application stating as follows: \u201cConsidering the reasons\n\nstated in the petition and for the just disposal of the case, this\n\npetition is allowed.\u201d\n\n           5.         This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code by\n\nthe accused in the cases for quashing Annexure-A4 order passed\n\nby the trial court.\n\n           6.         Heard learned counsel for the petitioner.\n\n           7.         Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that, if\n\nthe evidence of the complainant is reopened                                                                     and         if the\n\ncomplainant is allowed to adduce further evidence in the cases, it\n\nwould cause serious prejudice to the accused as it would amount\n\nto filling up of the lacuna in the case of the complainant.\n\n           8.         The complainant is an advertising company.  The case\n\nof the complainant is that the accused is the proprietor of\n\n'Madona Global Incorporates' and that the accused had publishedCrl.M.C.No.279/2020                                                  4\n\nadvertisements through the complainant on credit basis and the\n\ncheques were issued by the accused towards payment of the bills\n\nissued by the complainant.\n\n           9.         The plea taken by the accused during the trial of the\n\ncases is that he is not the proprietor of                                                               'Madona Global\n\nIncorporates' and that he had only introduced Mr.Sreekumar\n\nSreevalasan, who is the licensee of 'Madona Global Incorporates'\n\nto the complainant.\n\n           10.        The accused had earlier filed an application for\n\nsummoning certificate issued by the registering authority under\n\nSection 10 of the Emigration Act, 1983 in respect of 'Madona\n\nGlobal Incorporates' and to issue summons to a witness to prove\n\nthat document.  The aforesaid petition was dismissed by the trial\n\ncourt.  The accused then approached this Court and challenged\n\nthe          dismissal                 of         the           application                  filed           by          him            in\n\nCrl.M.C.No.6123/2019.                                            This                     Court                        dismissed\n\nCrl.M.C.No.6123/2019.  It is pertinent here to note that, while\n\ndismissing Crl.M.C.No.6123/2019, this Court had observed that it\n\nis the burden of the complainant to establish that the accused isCrl.M.C.No.279/2020                                                  5\n\nthe proprietor of 'Madona Global Incorporates' as alleged in the\n\ncomplaint.\n\n           11.        The         witnesses                sought             to      be        summoned                   by        the\n\ncomplainant are the Managers of the two banks in which the\n\naccused is maintaining account.  The documents sought to be\n\nproved through these witnesses are the account opening form\n\nand other documents showing the address of the accused given\n\nin the bank.  Evidently, the attempt of the complainant is to\n\nprove that the accused has opened accounts in the banks\n\ndescribing                himself             as        the         proprietor                of       'Madona                Global\n\nIncorporates'.\n\n           12.        Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, I\n\nfind that the examination of the witnesses sought to be\n\nsummoned by the complainant and the production of documents\n\nsought to be proved through such witnesses, are essential to the\n\njust decision in the cases.  There is no merit in the contention of\n\nthe petitioner/accused that it would cause serious prejudice to\n\nhim.  It would cause prejudice to him only if he has taken any\n\nfalse plea or defence during the trial of the case.Crl.M.C.No.279/2020                             6\n\n        13.     It is true that Annexure-A4 order passed by the trial\n\ncourt is not a lengthy one.  However, the trial court has observed\n\nthat for the just disposal of the cases, the petition filed by the\n\ncomplainant has to be allowed.\n\n        14.     It is also true that the petition was filed by the\n\ncomplainant at a belated stage.  However, it cannot be found that\n\nthe purpose of the petition is to fill up the lacuna in the case of\n\nthe complainant.\n\n        15. Section 311 of the Code states that any Court may, at\n\nany stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the\n\nCode, summon any person as a witness, or examine any person\n\nin attendance, though not summoned as a witness, or recall and\n\nre-examine any person already examined; and the Court shall\n\nsummon and examine or recall and re-examine any such person\n\nif his evidence appears to it to be essential to the just decision of\n\nthe case.\n\n        16. The first part of Section 311 of the Code is permissive\n\nand it gives purely discretionary authority to the Court and\n\nenables it at any stage of inquiry, trial or other proceedings underCrl.M.C.No.279/2020                                                  7\n\nthe Code to act in one of the three ways, namely, (i) to summon\n\nany person as a witness; or (ii) to examine any person in\n\nattendance, though not summoned as a witness; or (iii) to recall\n\nand re-examine any person already examined. The second part,\n\nwhich is mandatory, imposes an obligation on the Court (i) to\n\nsummon and examine or (ii) to recall and re-examine any such\n\nperson, if his evidence appears to be essential to the just\n\ndecision of the case.\n\n           17. It is well settled that the power conferred under Section\n\n311 of the Code  should be invoked by the Court only to meet the\n\nends of justice.  The Court has wide power under this provision to\n\neven recall witnesses for re-examination or further examination,\n\nnecessary in the interests of justice, but the same has to be\n\nexercised                after          taking            into         consideration                    the         facts           and\n\ncircumstances of each case. The power under this provision shall\n\nnot be exercised if the Court is of the view that the application\n\nhas been filed as an abuse of the process of law.\n\n           18.  There is no illegality in summoning or re-calling a\n\nwitness after closing the evidence in a case. The criminal courtCrl.M.C.No.279/2020                             8\n\nhas ample power to summon any person as a witness or recall\n\nand re-examine any such person even if the evidence on both\n\nsides is closed and the jurisdiction of the Court must obviously be\n\ndictated by the exigency of the situation.  Fair play and good\n\nsense appear to be the only safe guides in the matter.  Whether\n\nthe requirements of justice command the examination of any\n\nperson would depend on the facts and circumstances of each\n\ncase (See Mohanlal Shamji Soni v. Union of India : AIR\n\n1991 SC 1346).\n\n        19.     The plea of the petitioner that the attempt of the\n\ncomplainant is to fill up the lacuna in evidence by adducing\n\nadditional evidence also cannot be countenanced.  In Rajendra\n\nPrasad v. Narcotic Cell : AIR 1999 SC 2292, the Apex Court\n\nhas observed as follows:\n\n                    \u201cIt is a common experience in criminal courts\n                that    defence       counsel       would      raise     objections\n                whenever courts exercise powers under Section\n                311 of the Code or under Section 165 of the\n                Evidence Act by saying that the Court could not 'fill\n                the lacuna in the prosecution case'. A lacuna inCrl.M.C.No.279/2020                             9\n\n                prosecution is not to be equated with the fallout of\n                an oversight committed by a public prosecutor\n                during trial, either in producing relevant materials\n                or in eliciting relevant answers from witnesses.\n                The adage 'to err is human' is the recognition of\n                the    possibility      of   making       mistakes       to    which\n                humans are proned. A corollary of any such laches\n                or mistakes during the conducting of a case cannot\n                be understood as the lacuna which a court cannot\n                fill  up.  Lacuna  in  the  prosecution  must  be\n                understood as the inherent weakness or a latent\n                wedge in the matrix of the prosecution case. The\n                advantage of it should normally go to the accused\n                in the trial of the case, but an over sight in the\n                management of the prosecution cannot be treated\n                as irreparable lacuna. No party in a trial can be\n                foreclosed  from  correcting  errors.                   If    proper\n                evidence was not adduced or a relevant material\n                was      not     brought       on     record       due     to     any\n                inadvertence, the court should be magnanimous in\n                permitting such mistakes to be rectified. After all,\n                function of the criminal court is administration of\n                criminal justice and not to count errors committed\n                by the parties or to find out and declare who\n                among the parties performed better.\u201d\n                                                      (emphasis supplied).Crl.M.C.No.279/2020                             10\n\n        20.  In the aforesaid circumstances, the challenge raised by\n\nthe petitioner against Annexure-A4 order passed by the learned\n\nMagistrate fails.  The petition is liable to be dismissed.\n\n        Consequently, the petition is dismissed.\n\n                                                                (sd/-)\n\n                                          R.NARAYANA PISHARADI, JUDGE\njsr                                            APPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE A1                         THE TRUE COPY OF ORDER IN\n                                    CRL.M.C.NO.6123/19 DATED 29.08.2019 OF THE\n                                    HON'BLE COURT.\nANNEXURE A2                         THE TRUE COPY OF PETITION IN\n                                    C.M.P.NO.10421/19 DATED 23.10.2019.\nANNEXURE A3                         THE TRUE COPY OF OBJECTION IN\n                                    C.M.P.NO.10421/19 DATED 26.11.2019.\nANNEXURE A4                         THE TRUE COPY OF ORDER IN C.M.P.NO.10421/19\n                                    DATED 23.10.2019.\nRESPONDENTS' EXHIBITS:    NIL\n\n                         TRUE COPY\n                                       PS TO JUDGE"

Initially Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 541 of 2005 was filed in this Court\n\nby Mr. K.C. Palanisamy, accused No.3, who was also the Managing Director of\n\nDAIL and Mr. R. Karunanithi, the Director (Finance Operations) along with the\n\nPetitioners, i.e., Mr. Atthappan Ramasamy and Mr. Gobinath Atthapan seeking the\n\nquashing of Criminal Complaint No. 3142/2004.  However, subsequently the two\n\nPetitioners here sought leave to withdraw from the said petition to fie a separate\n\nfresh petition. This Court granted that permission.  DAIL also filed a separate\n\npetition Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 427 of 2005. Criminal Miscellaneous\n\nCase        No.       541/2005             by      Mr.Palanisamy                   and       Mr.Karunanithi                  and       Criminal\n\nMiscellaneous Case No. 427/2005 by DAIL were heard together by this Court. By\n\nan order dated 27th February 2007, the two petitions were dismissed.\n\n\n\n7. As far as the present petition is concerned, the two petitioners filed it on 16th\n\nMarch 2006 and by an order dated 17th March, 2006 while directing notice to issue,\n\nthis Court stayed the trial court proceedings.  Later it was clarified on 19th April\nCrl.MC 1409-10/2006                                                                                                             Page 3 of 17\n\n\n\n\n\n2007 that the stay of trial court proceedings was applicable only to the two\n\npetitioners here.\n\n\n\n8. The submissions of Mr. S. Gurukrishna Kumar, the learned counsel appearing\n\nfor the Petitioners were as follows:\n\n          (i)     There is no specific allegation against either of the petitioners in\n\n                     the complaint connecting them with the offence under Section\n\n                     138 NI Act.  Both the petitioners remained as Directors of DAIL\n\n                     for very short period and in fact resigned on 30th August 2004 as\n\n                     is evident from the copy of the Form 32 filed by the company in\n\n                     compliance                with        the      requirement                of     Section           303(2)          of     the\n\n                     Companies Act, 1956.\n\n          (ii)       The        date       of presentation                  of     the     cheque           for     payment             i.e.     1st\n\n                     September 2004 was the date on which the offence could be said\n\n                     to have been committed. On that date neither of the petitioners\n\n                     was a Director in the company. Therefore the essential ingredient\n\n                     of Section 141 NI Act in respect of the two petitioners was\n\n                     absent.\n\n          (iii)      The averments in the complaint when read as a whole only show\n\n                     that the language of the Section 141 has been mechanically\n\n                     reproduced.

In fact\n\n                    the cheques in question were signed by the Managing Director\n\n                    and the authorized signatory and not by the petitioners.\n\n          (v)       The dismissal by this Court of the two petitions under Section\n\n                    482 CrPC filed by Shri K.C.

Both of them resided outside India at the\n\n                     relevant time. At the time the notices were purported to have\n\n                     been sent to them at the address of DAIL, neither was a director\n\n                     in the company.\n\n          (vii)   The complaint is nothing but an abuse of the process of law with\n\n                    a view to harassing the petitioners, and extracting money when in\n\n                    fact they had relinquished their directorship of the company and\n\n                    could not be held responsible for the default of the company.\n\n\n\n9. Appearing for the Respondent, Mr. Sidharth Luthra, the learned Senior  Counsel\nCrl.MC 1409-10/2006                                                                                                             Page 5 of 17\n\n\n\n\n\nrefers to specific paragraphs of the complaint to show that the averments contained\n\ntherein satisfy the requirements of the law as explained by the Supreme Court. In\n\nparticular, he refers to the judgment in N. Rangachari v. Bharat Sanchar Nigam\n\nLtd. AIR 2007 SC 1682.  It has been pointed out by Mr. Luthra that the averments\n\ncontained in the complaint are not a mere reproduction of the language of the\n\nstatute, and any defence that the Petitioners may have to show that either they were\n\nno longer associated with the company at the time of the commission of the\n\noffence or that they had no knowledge of the issuance of the cheques in question,\n\ncould be examined at the trial. These are matters for which evidence would have to\n\nbe led before the trial court and examined by it.\n\n\n\n10.

On        a     reading            of     the       above           passages,              it    cannot           be       said        that       averments\n\nconcerning the Petitioners are a mere reproduction of the language of the statute.\n\nAs regards the petitioner no. 1 it is specifically stated that he \u201cbeing the Vice\n\nCrl.MC 1409-10/2006                                                                                                                                  Page 8 of 17\n\n\n\n\n\nChairman are always involved and responsible for the conduct of the business of\n\nthe Accused No.1 and they are always responsible and instrumental in the\n\nnegotiations and transactions with the Complainant\u2026.\u201d. As regards the petitioner\n\nNo.2 who is arraigned as accused No.6, there are sufficient averments concerning\n\nhis being in charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of its\n\nbusiness at the time of commission of the offence.  A further averment is that \u201cthe\n\nAccused were the persons responsible for the conduct of the business & affairs of\n\nthe Company at the time when the offence under Sec. 138 and Sec. 141 was\n\ncommitted.\u201d The complaint also alleges that the failure by the company to\n\ndischarge its liability was \u201cdirectly related and attributable to the consent and\n\nconnivance of Accused No. 2 to 9\u201d which is a separate offence in terms of Section\n\n138 read with Section 141 (2) of NI Act.\n\n\n\n12. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the law concerning the\n\nminimum averments necessary to be made in a complaint under Section 138 NI\n\nAct as explained by the Bench of three Hon\u201fble Judges of the Supreme Court in\n\nNeeta Bhalla I has been further explained in N.K. Wahi,  Saroj Kumar Poddar,\n\nEverest Advertising Pvt. Ltd. and Neeta Bhalla II. According to him, the latter\n\ndecisions hold that where a company is an accused in a complaint under Section\n\n138 NI Act, then apart from stating that the person sought to be arraigned as an\n\naccused in addition to the company was in charge of the affairs of the company and\n\nresponsible to it for the conduct of its business, a more specific averment as to the\n\nexact role and the manner in which the such Director or person was responsible for\n\nthe commission of the offence has to be indicated.\n\n\n\n13.  This Court finds that in Neeta Bhalla I, the Supreme Court based its decision\nCrl.MC 1409-10/2006                                                                                                                          Page 9 of 17\n\n\n\n\n\non the fact that a mere averment that a person is a Director of the accused company\n\nis not be sufficient to fasten liability on such person. It was in this context that the\n\nfollowing observations in paras 18 and 19 of the said judgment in Neeta Bhalla I\n\nhave to be understood (SCC pp. 102-03):\n\n         \u201c18. To sum up, there is almost unanimous judicial opinion that\n        necessary averments ought to be contained in a complaint before a\n        person can be subjected to criminal process. A liability under Section\n        141 of the Act is sought to be fastened vicariously on a person\n        connected with a Company, the principal accused being the company\n        itself. It is a departure from the rule in criminal law against vicarious\n        liability. A clear case should be spelled out in the complaint against the\n        person sought to be made liable. Section 141 of the Act contains the\n        requirements for making a person liable under the said provision. That\n        respondent falls within parameters of Section 141 has to be spelled out.\n        A complaint has to be examined by the Magistrate in the first instance\n        on the basis of averments contained therein. If the Magistrate is\n        satisfied that there are averments which bring the case within Section\n        141 he would issue the process. We have seen that merely being\n        described as a director in a company is not sufficient to satisfy the\n        requirement of Section 141. Even a non director can be liable under\n        Section 141 of the Act. The averments in the complaint would also\n        serve the purpose that the person sought to be made liable would know\n        what is the case which is alleged against him. This will enable him to\n        meet the case at the trial.\n\n        19. In view of the above discussion, our answers to the questions posed\n        in the reference are as under:\n\n        (a) It is necessary to specifically aver in a complaint under Section\n        141 that at the time the offence was committed, the person accused\n        was in charge of, and responsible for the conduct of business of\n        the company. This averment is an essential requirement of Section\n        141 and has to be made in a complaint. Without this averment being\n        made in a complaint, the requirements of Section 141 cannot be said\n        to be satisfied.\n\n        (b) The answer to question posed in sub-para (b) has to be in negative.\n        Merely being a director of a company is not sufficient to make the\n        person liable under Section 141 of the Act. A director in a company\n        cannot be deemed to be in charge of and responsible to the company\n        for conduct of its business. The requirement of Section 141 is that\n        the person sought to be made liable should be in charge of and\n        responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the\n        relevant time. This has to be averred as a fact as there is no\n        deemed liability of a director in such cases.\n\n        (c) The answer to Question (c) has to be in the affirmative.  The\nCrl.MC 1409-10/2006                                                                       Page 10 of 17\n\n\n\n\n\n        question notes that the managing director or joint managing director\n        would be admittedly in charge of the company and responsible to the\n        company for the conduct of its business. When that is so, holders of\n        such positions in a company become liable under Section 141 of the\n        Act. By virtue of the office they hold as managing director or joint\n        managing director, these persons are in charge of  and responsible for\n        the conduct of business of the company. Therefore, they get covered\n        under Section 141. So far as the signatory of a cheque which is\n        dishonoured is         concerned,       he    is   clearly    responsible       for   the\n        incriminating act and will be covered under sub-section (2) of Section\n        141.\u201d                                                          (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n14. The subsequent judgment in Saroj Kumar Poddar was dealing with a case\n\nwhere the averment in the complaint read as under (SCC p. 697):\n\n        \u201cThat    Accused      1  is   a  public    limited    company      incorporated       and\n        registered under the         Companies       Act,    1956,    and   Accused 2       to 8\n        are/were its Directors at the relevant time and the said Company is\n        managed by the Board of Directors and they are responsible for and in\n        charge of the conduct and business of the Company, Accused 1.\n        However, cheques referred to in the complaint have been signed by\n        Accused 3 and 8 i.e. Shri K.K. Pilania and Shri N.K. Munjal for and\n        on behalf of Accused 1 Company.\u201d\n\n\nThe above averment was held not to satisfy the requirement of Section 141 of the\n\nAct since it was not shown \u201cin what manner the appellant was responsible for the\n\nconduct of the business of the Company or otherwise responsible to it in regard to\n\nits functioning\u201d. It was pointed out that the appellant there had not issued any\n\ncheque and it had not been stated how he was responsible for the dishonor of the\n\ncheque.\n\n\n\n15. However, the above observations in the Saroj Kumar Poddar have been\n\nfurther explained by the Supreme Court in para 26 of the judgment in Neeta\n\nBhalla II as under (SCC p. 80):\n\n        \u201c26. A faint suggestion was made that this Court in Saroj Kumar\n\n        Poddar has laid down the law that the complaint petition not only\n\n        must contain averments satisfying the requirements of Section 141 of\nCrl.MC 1409-10/2006                                                                          Page 11 of 17\n\n\n\n\n\n            the Act but must also show as to how and in what manner the\n\n            appellant was responsible for the conduct of the business of the\n\n            company or otherwise responsible to it in regard to its functioning. A\n\n            plain reading of the said judgment would show that no such\n\n            general law was laid down therein. The observations were made\n\n            in the context of the said case as it was dealing with a contention\n\n            that        although               no      direct          averment                was        made           as      against            the\n\n            appellant of the said case fulfilling the requirements of Section\n\n            141 of the Act but there were other averments which would show\n\n            that        the       appellant               therein            was        liable         therefor.\u201d                     (emphasis\n\n            supplied)\n\n\n\nTherefore, it cannot be said that the above observations in Saroj Kumar Poddar\n\nconstitute the current law on the topic.\n\n\n\n16. In N.K. Wahi, the precise averments in the complaint in question were not\n\nreproduced in the judgment and, therefore, it is not possible to ascertain what the\n\nSupreme Court found to be insufficient as regards the description of the role of the\n\nDirector in question. Everest Advertising Pvt. Ltd. was a judgment in a case where\n\nthe person sought to be arraigned as an accused was the Managing Director.\n\nTherefore it was held that there was no need for the complainant to specifically\n\naver that such person was in charge of the day-to-day affairs of the company or\n\nresponsible               to     it    for       the      conduct             of     its     business.             However,               the       following\n\nobservations made in para 23 of the judgment show that the question whether a\n\nChairman would automatically be fastened with liability was not gone into (SCC p.\n\n63):\n\n            \u201c23. A Chairman of a large company may or may not be aware of the\n\n            actual         transaction               if    in     a    given         situation,            cheques            are      issued         in\n\n            ordinary course of business. The Managing Director or a Deputy\n\nCrl.MC 1409-10/2006                                                                                                                           Page 12 of 17\n\n\n\n\n\n            Managing Director, in view of S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. would be\n\n            deemed to be aware thereof. A Chairman or a Director of a company\n\n            need not be.  But, without going into the finer question raised by Mr.\n\n            Tulsi, we may notice that allegations have not only been made in\n\n            terms of the wordings of the section but also at more than one place, it\n\n            has categorically been averred that the payments were made after the\n\n            meetings held by and between the representatives of the Company and\n\n            Accused 1 to 5 which would include Respondents 2 and 3.\u201d\n\n\n\nThus the Supreme Court did not form a definitive opinion on whether a Chairman\n\ncould or could not be arraigned as an accused by stating in the complaint that such\n\nperson was in charge of the affairs of the company and responsible to it for the\n\nconduct of its business or whether something more had to be stated.\n\n\n\n17.  The judgment in Sabitha Ramamurthy was in a case where the accused was a\n\ncompany and there was no specific averment in regard to its directors. This is clear\n\nfrom the averments in the complaint which read as under (SCC pp. 583-84):\n\n            \u201cThe complainant submits that the accused persons have failed to\n\n            clear the liability. The accused, being the Company and all the\n\n            Directors, are responsible for the clearance of liability under Section\n\n            141 of the NI Act and the acts and deeds of the accused persons are\n\n            punishable under Section 138 of the NI Act...\u201d\n\n            \u201c\u2026Accused 2 is the MD and others are Chairman and partners. The\n\n            accused Company towards repayment of the loan, issued a cheque in\n\n            favour of the complainant. The MD signed and issued the cheque\n\n            dated 23-6-2001 for Rs. 1,24,406 on the account maintained by the\n\n            Company. On presentation of the said cheque to the bank for\n\n            collection, the same was returned on 30-6-2001 as insufficient funds.\n\n            Notice dated 12-7-2001 was issued through advocate to the accused\n\n            and was served on 13-7-2001. The case was filed on 27-8-2001\u2026.\u201d\n\n\n\nCrl.MC 1409-10/2006                                                                                                                      Page 13 of 17\n\n\n\n\n\n18. Clearly the said judgment cannot apply to the facts of the present case where\n\nthe complaint does not stop with merely stating that the petitioners 1 and 2 were\n\nthe Vice-Chairman and Director respectively of DAIL at the time of commission\n\nof the offence. Therefore, none of the above judgments is in fact helpful to the\n\nPetitioners in support of their submission that the averments in the present\n\ncomplaint are insufficient for the MM to have taken cognizance of the offence\n\ncomplained of and to have issued summons.\n\n\n\n19. On the other hand, in N. Rangachari, the complaint in question contained the\n\nfollowing averments (AIR SC p. 1684, para 4):\n\n            \u201cThat accused No. 1 is a company incorporated under the Companies\n\n            Act.  Accused Nos. 2 and 3 are its Directors.  They are incharge of\n\n            and responsible to accused No. 1 for conduct of business of accused\n\n            No. 1 Company.  They are jointly and severally liable for the acts of\n\n            accused No. 1.\u201d\n\n\n\n20. After discussing the entire case law up to that date in N. Rangachari, the\n\nSupreme Court in para 18 held as under (AIR SC p. 1688):\n\n\n            \u201c18. In the case on hand, reading the complaint as a whole, it is clear\n            that the allegations in the complaint are that at the time at which the\n            two dishonoured cheques were issued by the company, the appellant\n            and another were the Directors of the company and were incharge of\n            the affairs of the company. It is not proper to split hairs in reading\n            the complaint so as to come to a conclusion that the allegations as\n            a whole are not sufficient to show that at the relevant point of\n            time the appellant and the other are not alleged to be persons\n            incharge of the affairs of the company. Obviously, the complaint\n            refers to the point of time when the two cheques were issued, their\n            presentment, dishonour and failure to pay in spite of notice of\n            dishonour. We have no hesitation in overruling the argument in that\n            behalf by the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant.\u201d\n                                                                                                             (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\nCrl.MC 1409-10/2006                                                                                                                           Page 14 of 17\n\n\n\n\n\n21. As far as the present case is concerned, the complaint in question does contain\n\nnecessary averments to enable the MM to have taken cognizance of the offence\n\nagainst the Petitioners as well. The basic facts relevant for the learned MM to have\n\ntaken cognizance of the offence are not in dispute. The cheque in question i.e.\n\ncheque No. 809526 dated 26th August 2004 for a sum of Rs. 2,43,39,709/- issued\n\nby DAIL when presented for payment was dishonoured. On the date of the\n\nissuance of the cheque, both the petitioners were indeed Directors of the company.\n\nOne was the Vice Chairman and the other was the Director. It is not possible to\n\nagree with the submission of the counsel for the petitioners that the offence was\n\ncommitted only on 1st September 2004, i.e., the date of the presentation of the\n\ncheque. The presumption in terms of Section 138 read with Section 140 NI Act is\n\nthat the drawer of the cheque is presumed to have known that the cheque drawn\n\nwhen presented would be dishonoured. The cheque was drawn on 26th August\n\n2004. Under Section 140 it would be no defence for a person to urge that he was\n\nnot aware on the date the cheque was drawn that when presented for payment such\n\ncheque would be dishonoured. In the circumstances, the date of the commission of\n\nthe offence, cannot be sad to be the date of the dishonour of the cheque but the date\n\non which it was drawn. By their own showing, as seen from a copy of the Form 32\n\nenclosed with the present petition, the two petitioners had not resigned on the date\n\nthe cheque in question was drawn and issued.\n\n\n\n22. Any defence that the Petitioners may have to show that they were in fact not in\n\ncharge of the affairs of the company or responsible to it for the conduct of its\n\nbusiness, and in any event not on the date of the commission of the offence, can be\n\nproved at the trial by adducing evidence. The failure to serve a prior notice on the\n\npetitioners may not material for the purposes of the deemed offence under Section\nCrl.MC 1409-10/2006                                                                       Page 15 of 17\n\n\n\n\n\n138 read with Section 141 NI Act. However this and the contention that the\n\ncomplaint itself has been instituted malafide are matters that raise triable issues for\n\nwhich evidence is required to be led.\n\n\n\n23. For all of the aforementioned reasons, this Court is not inclined in exercise of\n\nits powers under Section 482 CrPC to interfere with the criminal proceedings\n\ninitiated against the petitioners under Section 138 NI Act.\n\n\n\n24. The learned counsel for the petitioners relied upon the judgment of the\n\nSupreme Court in M/s Bhaskar Industries Ltd. v. M/s Bhiwani Denim &\n\nApparels Ltd. 2001 [2] JCC [SC] 127 to contend that the petitioners should be\n\nexempted from personal appearance before the trial court. On the other hand, it has\n\nbeen pointed out by the learned counsel for the respondent that the petitioners have\n\nnot appeared even once before the trial court till date and, therefore, they should\n\nnot be granted this indulgence. In any event this should be left to the discretion of\n\nthe trial court.\n\n\n\n25. It is directed that if a request is made by the Petitioners here by an appropriate\n\napplication before the learned MM for exemption from appearance, the same\n\nshould be considered on its merits and upon such conditions as may be deemed\n\nnecessary by the learned MM having regard to the need to secure the presence of\n\nthe petitioners at subsequent stages of the trial. It is also made clear that the\n\npetitioners should appear as and when directed by the learned MM to ensure the\n\nfair progress of the trial.\n\n\n\n26. The petition is dismissed. The interim order dated 17th March, 2006 stands\nCrl.MC 1409-10/2006                                                                                                                           Page 16 of 17\n\n\n\n\n\nvacated and the stay application is also dismissed. There will be no order as to\n\ncosts.\n\n\n\n                                                                          S.

This is a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973\n\n(\u201eCrPC\u201f) seeking the quashing of the proceedings arising out of the complaint case\n\nNo. 877/1/2006 titled Arjun Kohli v. Alfa Graphics pending in the court of the\n\nlearned Metropolitan Magistrate (\u201eMM\u201f), Delhi.  The complaint has been filed by\n\nthe Respondent against the Petitioner for the offence under Section 138 read with\n\nSection 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (\u201eNI Act\u201f) and Section 420 of\n\nthe Indian Penal Code 1860 (\u201eIPC\u201f).\n\n\n\n2. The only accused person shown in the complaint is as under:\n\n                \u201cM/s Alfa Graphics\n\n                7, Neelkanth Apartment,\n\nCrl M C 4259/2006                                                                               Page 1 of 7\n\n\n\n                      Gokuldas Pasta Road,\n\n                      Dadar, East Mumbai\n\n                      (Through its Partner).\u201d\n\n\n\n3. Para 3 of the complaint lists out 20 cheques drawn by the Petitioner M/s. Alfa\n\nGraphics          in   favour of           the     complainant Respondent in the aggregate                                        sum       of\n\nRs.2,26,240.00.  It is stated that each of the cheques when presented by the\n\ncomplainant to the bank for payment was returned dishonoured on account of\n\n\u201cinsufficient funds\u201d.\n\n\n\n4. The learned MM directed issuance of summons requiring the appearance of the\n\nPetitioner before him on 30th May 2006 to face trial for the offence under Section\n\n138 NI Act. The present petition was filed on 24th July 2006. By an order dated\n\n26th     July       2006        an      interim         order       was       passed         exempting             the      Petitioner\u201fs\n\nrepresentative from personal appearance subject to appearing through counsel\n\nbefore the trial court.\n\n\n\n5. Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior counsel appearing for the Petitioner urges two\n\npoints in support of the prayer quashing of the criminal complaint. The first is that\n\nthe Petitioner is a partnership firm and has been arrayed as an accused without\n\nindicating the name of the partner.  He submits that in terms of Section 141 NI Act\n\nread with the Explanation (a) thereto unless a partner of the firm is also named as\n\nan accused and it is specifically averred that such partner was in charge of the\n\naffairs of the firm and responsible to it for the conduct of its business, no liability\n\nwhatever can attach to the firm. A reference has also been made to the decision of\n\nthe Supreme Court in Monaben Ketanbhai Shah v. State of Gujarat AIR 2004 SC\n\nCrl M C 4259/2006                                                                                                                Page 2 of 7\n\n\n\n4274. Secondly, it is urged that there cannot be one complaint for as many as 20\n\ncheques. A reference has been made to Section 219 CrPC to contend that no person\n\ncan be charged and tried at one trial for more than three offences of the same kind\n\ncommitted within the space of twelve months.\n\n\n\n6. In order to appreciate the first contention a reference may be made to both\n\nSections 138 and 141 NI Act which read as under:\n\n                      \u201cSection 138 Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc. of\n                      funds in the account \u2013 Where any cheque drawn by a person\n                      on an account maintained by him with a banker for payment of\n                      any amount of money to another person from out of that\n                      account for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or\n                      other liability is returned by the bank unpaid, either because of\n                      the amount of money standing to the credit of that account is\n                      insufficient to honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount\n                      arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made\n                      with that bank, such person shall be deemed to have committed\n                      an offence and shall, without prejudice to any other provision\n                      of this Act, be punished with imprisonment for a term which\n                      may be extended to two years or with fine which may extend\n                      to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both:\n\n                                Provided         that     nothing        contained          in    this    section        shall\n                      apply unless-\n\n                 (a) The cheque has been presented to the bank within a period of\n                      six months from the date on which it is drawn or within the\n                      period of its validity, whichever is earlier;\n\n                 (b) The payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as the\n                      case may be, makes a demand for the payment of the said\n                      amount of money by giving a notice in writing, to the drawer\n                      of the cheque within thirty days of the receipt of information\n                      by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as\n                      unpaid; and\n\n                 (c)  The drawer of such cheque fails to make the payment of the\n                      said amount of money to the payee or as the case may be, to\n                      the holder in due course of the cheque within fifteen days of\n                      the receipt of the said notice.\n\n                 Explanation \u2013 For the purposes of this section, \u201cdebt or other\n                 liability\u201d means a legally enforceable debt or other liability.\n\n\n\nCrl M C 4259/2006                                                                                                             Page 3 of 7\n\n\n\n             Section 141 Offences by companies \u2013\n\n             (1) If the person committing an offence under Section 138 is a\n             company, every person who, at the time the offence was\n             committed, was incharge of, and was responsible to the company\n             for the conduct of the business of the company, as well as the\n             company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be\n             liable to proceeded against and punished accordingly:\n\n             Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall render\n             any person liable to punishment if he proves that the offence was\n             committed without his knowledge, or that he had exercised all\n             due diligence to prevent the commission of such offence.\n\n             Provided further that where a person is nominated as a Director of\n             a company by virtue of his holding any office or employment in\n             the Central Government or State Government or a financial\n             corporation owned or controlled by the Central Government or\n             the State Government, as the case may be, he shall not be liable\n             for prosecution under this Chapter:\n\n             (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), where\n             any offence under this Act has been committed by a company and\n             it is proved that the offence has been committed with the consent\n             or connivance of, or is attributable to, any neglect on the part of\n             any director, manager, secretary or other officer of the company,\n             such director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be\n             deemed to be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be\n             proceeded against and punished accordingly.\n\n             Explanation \u2013 For the purposes of this section \u2013\n\n                 (a) \u201ccompany\u201d means any body corporate and includes a firm\n                 or other association of individuals;

The Explanation to Section 141 makes it clear that wherever there is a reference\n\nunder Section 141 to a \u201ecompany\u201f  it has to be substituted by the word \u201efirm\u201f where\n\nthe accused is a partnership firm and the provision has to be read as if it refers to\n\nthe firm. What this means is that a complaint can be filed for the offence under\n\nSection 138 NI Act not only against the partnership firm on whose behalf the\n\ncheque was issued but also against an individual partner or person who, at the time\n\nof the commission of the offence, was in charge of the affairs of the firm or\n\nresponsible to it for the conduct of its business. There is nothing in the provision\n\nCrl M C 4259/2006                                                                               Page 4 of 7\n\n\n\nwhich indicates that in every complaint involving the dishonour of a cheque issued\n\nby a firm both the firm as well as its partners have to be compulsorily impleaded.\n\nIn other words a complaint in which only the firm is made an accused and the\n\npartners are not would not be bad in law for that reason. Clearly that is not the\n\nintention of the Parliament.\n\n\n\n8. A partnership firm is a separate legal entity in terms of the Indian Partnership\n\nAct 1932 and it is answerable in law in that capacity. That is how under various\n\nstatutes like the Income Tax Act 1961, the Central Excises Act 1944, the Sales Tax\n\nLaws and Section 141 NI Act, a firm can be proceeded against as such. It is\n\nperfectly possible for a complainant, aggrieved by the dishonour of a cheque issued\n\nby or behalf of a firm, to file a complaint for the offence under Section 138 NI Act\n\nonly against the firm. The complainant may choose not to proceed against the\n\nindividual partners as accused either because he is not aware as to who are the\n\npartners or is not interested in proceeding against the partners apart from the firm.\n\nWhen the firm receives the summons, it would naturally appoint or authorize some\n\none to represent the firm in the proceedings before the court. It is not open to a\n\nfirm that is issued summons to contend that it does not have to appear in the\n\nproceedings because the complaint does not also arraign the partner or partners of\n\nthe firm as co-accused. A comparison could be drawn with Section 305 CrPC\n\nwhich requires a company which is summoned to appear as an accused in a\n\ncriminal proceeding to indicate who will appear on its behalf. A company cannot\n\npossibly contend that although it has been named as an accused it need not\n\nparticipate in the proceedings only because the person in charge of the affairs of\n\nthe company at the time of commission of the offence has not been named as\n\naccused.\n\nCrl M C 4259/2006                                                                               Page 5 of 7\n\n\n\n\n\n9. The judgment of the Supreme Court in Monaben Ketanbhai Shah v. State of\n\nGujarat was dealing with a situation different from the one in the present case.\n\nThere the firm as well as its partners were sought to be arraigned as accused. The\n\nSupreme Court held that the complaint should contain a specific averment as to the\n\nrole of each of the partners and in particular that they were in charge of the affairs\n\nof the firm and responsible to it for the conduct of its business at the time of the\n\ncommission of the offence. Here that question does not arise since the firm alone is\n\narraigned as an accused. Therefore the first submission of the learned Senior\n\ncounsel for the petitioner is rejected.\n\n\n\n10. Turning to the next submission regarding one complaint being filed for as\n\nmany as 20 dishonoured cheques, a reference may be made to Section 219 CrPC\n\nwhich reads as under:\n\n                \u201cSection 219  Three offences of same kind within year may\n                be charged together -\n\n            (1) When a person is accused of more offences than one of the\n                same kind committed within the space of twelve months from\n                the first to the last of such offences, whether in respect of the\n                same person or not, he may be charged with, and tried at one\n                trial for, any number of them not exceeding three.\n\n            (2) Offences are of the same kind when they are punishable with\n                the same amount of punishment under the same section of the\n                Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or of any special or local laws:\n\n                Provided that, for the purposes of this section, an offence\n                punishable under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of\n                1860)  shall be deemed to be an offence of the same kind as an\n                offence punishable under Section 380 of the  said Code, and\n                that an offence punishable under any section of the said Code,\n                or of any special or local law, shall be deemed to be an offence\n                of the same kind as an attempt to commit such offence, when\n                such an attempt is an offence.\u201d\n\n\n\nCrl M C 4259/2006                                                                               Page 6 of 7\n\n\n\n11. The purport of the above provision is that where a person is accused of more\n\nthan one offence of the same kind committed within the space of twelve months he\n\ncan be charged \u201cand tried at one trial for, any number of them not exceeding\n\nthree.\u201d  The stage for determining whether there should be more than one charge\n\nand therefore more than one trial has not yet been reached. That will be decided at\n\nthe appropriate stage by the learned trial court as and when charges are framed.\n\nThis issue should therefore be appropriately addressed to that Court. The mere\n\nreference in the complaint to 20 cheques as having been dishonoured cannot render\n\nthe complaint bad in law or not maintainable. The order of the learned MM issuing\n\nsummons also does not get invalidated on that score. The second submission of\n\nlearned Senior counsel for the Petitioner is also rejected.\n\n\n\n12. Accordingly, this petition is dismissed with no orders as to costs. The interim\n\norder granted on 26th July 2006 stands vacated and the application stands\n\ndismissed. A certified copy of this order be sent to the court of the learned MM in\n\nwhose court complaint case No. 877/1/2006 titled Arjun Kohli v. Alfa Graphics is\n\npending within five days.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      S.

BASANT, J.\n                  -------------------------------------------------\n                          Crl.M.C. No. 4211 of   2008\n                  -------------------------------------------------\n             Dated this the  6th  day of November, 2008\n\n                                          ORDER\n\n        Can a person facing allegations in a prosecution under\n\nSec.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and  against whom\n\na warrant of arrest \u2013 bailable or non-bailable, has been issued\n\nby a Magistrate to procure his presence appear before the\n\nMagistrate through counsel and claim exemption  under\n\nSec.205 Cr.P.C. and plead guilty?  Should his personal\n\npresence be insisted?  This is the short question that is raised\n\nby the petitioner in this Crl.M.C.\n\n        2.   The petitioner faces indictment in prosecutions under\n\nSec.138 of the N.I. Act.  The prosecutions are pending before\n\nthe learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thrissur and the learned\n\nJudicial Magistrates of First Class, Thrissur and Kunnamkulam.\n\nThe  allegations relate to cheques issued by the petitioner for Crl.M.C. No. 4211 of   2008 -: 2 :-\n\nthe discharge of liability under the E.S.I. Act and the Employees'\n\nProvident Fund Act.  In some of the cases, the petitioner has\n\nentered appearance. In some others, the petitioner has not\n\nentered appearance.  In some others, warrants of arrest have\n\nbeen issued against the petitioner.  He has already discharged\n\nthe liability under the cheques.  The petitioner wants to appear\n\nbefore such courts through counsel and plead guilty in all the\n\ncases.   The petitioner apprehends that as warrants are pending\n\nagainst him in some of these cases, he may not be permitted to\n\nplead guilty through counsel.  It is hence prayed that appropriate\n\ndirections may be issued to enable him to so appear before the\n\nlearned Magistrates through counsel and plead guilty.\n\n           3.  The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the\n\npetitioner is obliged to approach this Court as the question does\n\nnot appear to have been decided finally and conclusively in Jain\n\nBabu v. Joseph (ILR 2008 (4) Kerala 88). As a consequence,\n\nMagistrates are insisting even when the accused want to plead\n\nguilty or take part in the proceedings through counsel that such\n\napplications  cannot  be  entertained  without  the  personal\n\npresence of the accused.\n\n           4.  I find no basis for this apprehension.   In  Jain Babu   in\n\npara-16  I  have  quoted  the  decision  of  Mr.  Justice  K.V. Crl.M.C. No. 4211 of   2008 -: 3 :-\n\nSankaranayaranan in Raman Nair v. State of Kerala  (1999 (3)\n\nKLT 714).  In that, the learned Judge has referred with approval\n\nto some decisions \u201cwhich go to the extent that warrants issued\n\ncan be withdrawn and exemption granted under S.205 Cr.P.C. on\n\napplication of the accused.\u201d\n\n        5.  The question demands and warrants a look at the\n\nfundamentals. The summons as well as warrants whether\n\nbailable or not are only processes to secure the presence of an\n\nindictee before court.   Be it not forgotten that both the summons\n\nand warrants are only issued in the attempt of the court to\n\nsecure the presence of the summonee/warrantee.  Where the\n\npersonal presence of such summonee/warantee is not necessary\n\nfor the progress of the case and he can be exempted from\n\npersonal appearance before court, there can be no reason to\n\nritualistically insist on the  presence of the summoneee/warantee\n\nto facilitate consideration of the application for exemption.  If\n\npersonal presence is not required and can be exempted under\n\nSec.205 Cr.P.C., the application for exemption can be allowed\n\nwithout personal presence whether such personal appearance is\n\nrequested/mandated by issue of  summons or warrant.  All\n\nsummons cases, and all other cases where summons is issued at\n\nthe first instance  under Sec.204 Cr.P.C. shall fall within the Crl.M.C. No. 4211 of   2008 -: 4 :-\n\nsweep of Sec.205 Cr.P.C.   In such a case where the court is\n\nsatisfied that there is reason to grant exemption under Sec.205\n\nCr.P.C., the fact that a warrant has been issued later is no reason\n\nto insist on the personal presence of the indictee to consider an\n\napplication for exemption \u2013 whether  to plead guilty or not guilty.\n\n        6.  It is for the petitioner to appear before the Magistrate\n\nconcerned to claim exemption under Sec.205 Cr.P.C. and choose\n\nto make appropriate plea.  When he makes an application under\n\nSec.205 Cr.P.C., the Magistrate concerned will certainly be not\n\njustified in not taking up the application for exemption for\n\nconsideration merely on the ground that a warrant of arrest has\n\nalso been issued.   Where the plea is one of guilty and the\n\nlearned Magistrate is satisfied that the counsel has been\n\nauthorised to make that plea of guilty, I can find no earthly\n\nreason  which should persuade a Magistrate to insist on the\n\npersonal presence of such indictee to consider the application for\n\nexemption.\n\n        7.  This Crl.M.C. is allowed to the above extent.  The\n\npetitioner can appear through his counsel notwithstanding the\n\nfact that warrants of arrest are pending against him.   He can\n\napply for exemption under Sec.205 Cr.P.C. to make his plea.\n\nThe learned Magistrate must consider the prayer.   To consider Crl.M.C. No. 4211 of   2008 -: 5 :-\n\nthat prayer, the learned Magistrate need not insist on his\n\npersonal presence.\n\n                                                            (R. BASANT, JUDGE)\n\nNan/"

The respondent-original complainant initiated penal\n\nproceedings against the applicant for the charge of dishonour of\n\ncheque.   The respondent-complainant, in order to bring home\n\nthe guilt of  applicant-accused, adduced evidence on record.  The\n\nlearned Magistrate appreciated the evidence and held applicant-\n\naccused guilty for the offence punishable under Section 138 of\n\nthe NI Act. Learned Magistrate sentenced the applicant-accused\n\nto suffer simple imprisonment for one year and to deposit an\n\namount of  Rs. 6,50,000/- (Rs.

Being dissatisfied with the impugned Judgment and\n\norder of conviction and resultant sentence of compensation, the\n\napplicant preferred an appeal before the learned Additional\n\nSessions Judge, Kopargaon, to redress his grievance.  The appeal\n\nfiled on behalf of applicant came to be admitted and learned                                                               3                                                CriA-3623-18\n\nAdditional Sessions Judge was also pleased to suspend the\n\nsubstantive sentence of imprisonment and enlarge the accused-\n\napplicant on bail pending the appeal.\n\n5.                      The learned Additional Sessions Judge, Kopargaon\n\nalso simultaneously passed impugned order dated 22-11-2018\n\nand directed the appellant-applicant to deposit amount of\n\nRs.2,00,000/-                     (Rs.          Two          Lakhs            Only)            being           an        part          of\n\ncompensation amount awarded by the learned Magistrate, in the\n\nCourt, by the next date.  The impugned order passed by learned\n\nAdditional Sessions Judge, is the subject-matter in the present\n\napplication.\n\n6.                      The learned counsel for applicant explained entire\n\nfactual aspects in detail and submits that the learned Magistrate\n\ncommitted error while imposing heavy amount of compensation\n\non the applicant-accused.  The learned Additional Sessions Judge\n\nalso directed to deposit Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rs. Two Lakhs Only),\n\nbeing part payment of compensation within stipulated period.  He\n\ncontends that the substantive sentence of imprisonment has\n\nalready been suspended by the learned Additional Sessions Judge\n\nand the applicant-accused was enlarged on bail pending the\n\nappeal.             In such circumstances, the appellate Court has no\n\njurisdiction                to        impose              such           conditions                 for        payment                 of\n\ncompensation partly, pending the appeal.  Learned counsel for                                           4                                                CriA-3623-18\n\nthe applicant gave much more emphasis on the provisions of\n\nSection 357 of Cr.P.C. and submits that if appeal is filed against\n\nthe impugned order of conviction and sentence of fine or\n\ncompensation, it is not necessary to make payment of such fine\n\nor compensation till decision of the appeal.  He further submits\n\nthat amount of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rs. Two Lakhs Only), as directed\n\nby the Appellate Court, to deposit in the Court, towards part of\n\ncompensation, is exorbitant and excessive. The learned counsel\n\nfor applicant requested to quash and set aside the impugned\n\norder and directed the appellate forum to entertain the appeal\n\nwithout any deposit of compensation amount awarded by learned\n\nMagistrate, pending the appeal.\n\n7.              I have given anxious consideration to the rival\n\ncontentions propounded on behalf of both sides.  The submission\n\nof learned counsel appearing for the applicant appears not\n\nsustainable and considerable one. In the case of - Hari Singh\n\nVersus Sukhbir Singh and others, reported in, 1988 SCC\n\n(Cri.) 984,         the Honourable Apex Court had an occasion to\n\nconsider the effect of Section 357 of Cr.P.C., and in particular\n\nSub-section (3) thereof.  The relevant paragraphs No. 10 and 11\n\nof said judgment would read as under:-\n\n                    \u201c10.     Sub-section (1) of           Section 357       provides\n            power to award compensation to victims of the offence\n            out of the sentence of fine imposed on accused. In this\n            case, we are not concerned with sub-section (1). We are                                           5                                                CriA-3623-18\n\n            concerned only with sub-section (3). It is an important\n            provision but Courts have seldom invoked it. Perhaps due\n            to ignorance of the object of it, it empowers the Court to\n            award compensation to victims while passing judgment\n            of conviction. In addition to conviction, the Court may\n            order the accused to pay some amount by way of\n            compensation to victim who has suffered by the action of\n            accused. It may be noted that this power of Courts to\n            award compensation is not ancillary to other sentences\n            but it is in addition thereto. This power was intended to\n            do something to re-assure the victim that he or she is\n            not forgotten in the criminal justice system. It is a\n            measure of responding appropriately to crime as well of\n            reconciling the victim with the offender. It is, to some\n            extent. a constructive approach to, crimes. It is indeed a\n            step  forward  in  our  criminal  justice  system.  We,\n            therefore,recommend to all Courts to exercise this power\n            liberally so as to meet the ends of justice in a better way.\n\n            11.     The payment by way of compensation must,\n            however, be reasonable What is reasonable, may depend\n            upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The\n            quantum of compensation may be determined by taking\n            into account the nature of crime, the justness of claim by\n            the victim and the ability of accused to pay. If there are\n            more than one accused they may be asked to pay in\n            equal     terms     unless     their    capacity      to    pay    varies\n            considerably. The payment may also vary depending\n            upon the acts of each accused. Reasonable period for\n            payment of compensation, if necessary by installments,\n            may also be given. The Court may enforce the order by\n            imposing sentence in default.\u201d\n\n8.              It is worth to mention that the Honourable Apex\n\nCourt, in the case of - Dalmiya Cement (Bharat) Limited                                                               6                                                CriA-3623-18\n\nVersus  Galazy  Traders  Agencies  Limited  and  others,\n\nreported in, MANU/SC/1722/2001 : 2001 CriLJ 972, held\n\nthat Section 138 makes a civil transaction to be an offence by\n\nlegal fiction. The Honourable Apex Court held that the object of\n\nthe  said  provision  is  of  making  a  special  provision  by\n\nincorporating a strict liability so far as a cheque is concerned.\n\nThe Honourable Apex Court further held that efforts to defeat the\n\nobjectives of law by resorting to innovative measures and\n\nmethods are to be discouraged.\n\n9.                      At this juncture, it would apposite to make a\n\nreference of decision of the Honourable Apex Court in the case of\n\nStanny Felix Pinto Versus Jangid Builders Private Limited\n\nand another, reported in,  MANU/SC/0034/2001 : 2001(2)\n\nSCC 416.                   In said Judgment, the Honourable Apex Court\n\nelucidated as under:-\n\n                                \u201c2.   When a person was convicted under\n                   Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and\n                   sentenced to imprisonment and fine he moved the\n                   superior court for suspension of the sentence. The\n                   High Court while entertaining his revision granted\n                   suspension of the sentence by imposing a condition\n                   that part of the fine shall be remitted in court\n                   within a specified time. It is against the said\n                   direction that this petition has been filed. In our\n                   view the High Court has done it correctly and in\n                   the         interest             of      justice.            We          feel        that          while                                           7                                                CriA-3623-18\n\n             suspending the sentence for the offence under\n             Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, it is\n             advisable that the court imposes a condition that\n             the fine part is remitted within a certain period. If\n             the fine amount is heavy, the court can direct at\n             least a portion thereof to be remitted as the\n             convicted  person  wants  the  sentence  to  be\n             suspended during the pendency of the appeal. In\n             this case the grievance of the appellant is that he\n             is required by the High Court to remit a huge\n             amount of rupees four lakhs as a condition to\n             suspend the sentence. When considering the total\n             amount of fine imposed by the trial court (twenty\n             lakhs  of  rupees)  there  is  nothing  unjust  or\n             unconscionable  in  imposing  such  a  condition.\n             Hence, there is no need to interfere with the\n             impugned order. As such no notice need be issued\n             to  the  respondent.                 Appeal        is    accordingly\n             dismissed.\u201d\n\n10.             In the light of aforesaid exposition of law laid down by\n\nthe Honourable Apex Court, it is evident that while suspending\n\nthe sentence for the offence under Section 138 of NI Act, it is\n\nadvisable that the appellate Court imposes condition of deposit of\n\ncompensation, keeping in mind the provisions of Section 138 of\n\nNI Act. When the amount of compensation is heavy, the Court\n\ncan direct deposit of an reasonable amount.  Only in exceptional\n\ncases, the Appellate Court can grant interim protection without\n\nrequiring deposit of compensation amount.                                           8                                                CriA-3623-18\n\n11.             In the matter in hand, the learned Magistrate imposes\n\nan compensation of Rs.6,50,000/- (Rs. Six Lakhs Fifty Thousands\n\nOnly) to be deposited in the Court, within 30 days, from the date\n\nof Judgment and order.  However, the Appellate Court, taking\n\ninto consideration the quantum of compensation, directed the\n\napplicant-accused to deposit the amount of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rs.\n\nTwo Lakhs Only) being part of compensation till next date.  In\n\nview of aforesaid ratio laid down by the Honourable Apex Court,\n\nthe leaned Additional Sessions Judge was justified in imposing\n\nthe condition of depositing Rs.2,00,000/- (Rs. Two Lakhs Only) in\n\nthe Court, pending the appeal.  The learned counsel for applicant\n\nmade an abortive attempt to make a reference of provision under\n\nSection 357 of Cr.P.C to point out that in case the appeal is filed,\n\nthere is no requirement to make payment till decision of the\n\nappeal.  As referred above, in view of legal guidelines delineated\n\nby the Honourable Apex Court discussed above, I do not find any\n\nforce in the contentions propounded on behalf of learned counsel\n\nfor the applicant.            In short, the impugned order passed by\n\nlearned Additional Sessions Judge issuing directions to the\n\napplicant-accused to deposit Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rs. Two Lakhs\n\nOnly), pending the appeal, appears to be just, proper and\n\nreasonable one.            There is no abuse of process of law.                          No\n\ninterference is warranted to meet the ends of justice by\n\nexercising inherent powers under section 482 of Cr.P.C.                                                               9                                                CriA-3623-18\n\n12.                     With            the          aforesaid                 discussion,                   the          Criminal\n\nApplication, being devoid of merit, deserves to be dismissed.\n\nAccordingly, Criminal Application stands dismissed.  Rule stands\n\ndischarged.  No order as to costs.\n\n                                                                                      Sd/-\n\n                                                                          [ K.

Petitioner.\n\n\t\t\tVersus\n\n\nG.Sankara Narayanan\t\t\t\t.. Respondent. \n\n\n\nPrayer:  Petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C seeking to call for the records pertaining to the proceedings in C.C.No.1050 of 2004 pending before the District Munsif cum Judicial Magistrate, Ambattur and quash the same. \n\n\t\tFor Petitioner     :   Mr.S.D.Ramalingam\n\n\t\tFor Respondent     :   Mr.N.Kumanan\n\t\t\t\t       Government Advocate (Crl. Side)\n\n\n\nO R D E R\t\n\n\n\tThe petitioner is the sole accused in C.C.No.1050 of 2004 on the file of the learned District Munsif cum Judicial Magistrate, Ambattur for an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. \n\n\n\t2. In the notice given, a demand has been made for making payment of the money mentioned in those two cheques, each for Rs.5,000/- dated 31.03.2004 and 30.04.2004. Since it has not been paid, it resulted in the complaint before the learned Magistrate.\n\n\t3. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that in the statutory notice given, though two cheques each for Rs.5,000/- has been mentioned, in the last paragraph, it has been mentioned as follows:\n\t\"Therefore, you are hereby called upon to pay the said amount of Rs.5,65,150/- within 15 days on receipt of this notice..\".\n\n\t4. Relying on the language used in the last paragraph of the notice, it is contended that the demand made is confusing. The petitioner could not understand whether the demand has been made for the two cheques, each for Rs.5,000/- or for Rs.5,65,150/-. When a notice is given, it must convey the actual demand and it must be unambiguous to constitute the offence, in the event of the failure of payment of the amount mentioned in the cheque. \n\n\t\n\t5. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner relied on a case reported in (2000 (I) KLT 701 SC) Suman Sethi Vs. Ajay and relied on the passage, which reads as follows:\n\t\"If, however, in the notice an omnibus demand is made without specifying what was the due under the dishonoured cheque, notice might well fail to meet the legal requirement and may be regarded as bad\".\n\n\t6. The counsel for the petitioner also relied on a case reported in (1996(2) KLT 886 (Calcutta) Goppa Devi Ozha Vs. Sujit Paul), wherein it has been held as follows:\n\t\"The wording in clause(b) to the proviso of S.138 \"a demand for payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice, in writing, to the drawer of the cheque\", refers to the cheque amount and not any other amount either smaller or higher than the amount mentioned in the cheque. So, the notice need to be given demanding the cheque amount. If any bigger amount or smaller amount than the cheque amount is mentioned, in my view, that will amount difficulty to the drawee to know how much amount he has to pay or she has to pay as the case may be and that makes the notice insufficient and vague and the notice will become illegal.\"\n\n\t7. Per contra the learned counsel for the respondent/complainant submits that notice as well as the complaint has been given for two cheques, wherein the amount mentioned is for Rs.5,000/- each and the figure mentioned in the last paragraph of the notice is a typographical error. However, in the private complaint filed, correct figures have been given. It is further submitted that apart from those two cheques mentioned in paragraph 1 and 2 of the notice, no other amount is mentioned in the notice, as well as in the complaint. \n\n\t8. I have perused the materials available on record.\n\n\t9. A reply notice has been given by the petitioner on 07.09.2004, in which, the petitioner correctly understood that the notice has been given only for those two cheques each for Rs.5,000/- and further in the second paragraph, it is admitted that they are willing to make payment of Rs.10,000/-, but due to some financial constraint the same could not be done. Therefore, it appears that the present point agitated by the petitioner appears to be a belated one and an after thought. \n\n\t10. It is further contended that the petitioner is liable to pay only Rs.5,000/-. The second cheque has not been issued to the complainant at all and erroneously the same also has been taken into consideration for issuance of notice to the petitioner. The counsel for the respondent/complainant submits that these two cheques are given to the complainant and the same has been admitted in the reply notice. Even otherwise, these disputed facts may have to be agitated only before the trial Court.\n\n\t11. In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, I do not find any merit in this petition to quash the proceedings. Therefore, the petition is dismissed. Consequently, connected Crl.M.Ps are closed. \t\t\n\n\n\ncsh\n\n\nTo\n\nThe District Munsif cum \nJudicial Magistrate, Ambattur."

For the sake of convenience, the petitioner and the respondent will be referred to as accused and complainant, respectively.\n\n\t3. It is the case of the complainant that the accused borrowed monies from him, as per details below:\nDate on which the accused borrowed money\nAmount (Rs.)\n16.09.2009\n 50,000/&#126;\n28.10.2009\n 3,00,000/&#126;\n18.11.2009\n 3,00,000/&#126;\n01.12.2009\n 3,50,000/&#126;\nTotal\n 10,00,000/&#126;\n\n\n\n\nIn discharge of the aforesaid liabilities, the accused issued three cheques, the details of which are as follows:\nSl.No.\nCheque bearing No.\nCheque amount\nCheque dated\nDrawn on\n1\n021218\nRs.3,00,000/&#126;\n25.01.2010\nICICI Bank, R.S.Puram Branch, Coimbatore.\n2\n021700\nRs.2,00,000/&#126;\n25.01.2010\nICICI Bank, R.S.Puram Branch, Coimbatore.\n3\n021717\nRs.5,00,000/&#126;\n25.01.2010\nICICI Bank, R.S.Puram Branch, Coimbatore.\n\nThe complainant presented all the three cheques, but, they were dishonoured; the complainant informed this to the accused, pursuant to which, the accused gave a sum of Rs.2,00,000/&#126; on 27.01.2010, Rs.2,00,000/&#126; on 31.01.2010 and Rs.1,00,000/&#126; on 08.02.2010, totally Rs.5,00,000/&#126; and got back the two cheques viz., the cheque dated 25.01.2010 bearing No.021218 for the sum of  Rs.3,00,000/&#126;  and the cheque dated 25.01.2010 bearing No.021700 for the sum of Rs.2,00,000/&#126; that were given by him earlier; the accused requested the complainant to re&#126;present the cheque (Ex&#126;P1)dated 25.01.2010 bearing No.021717 for the sum of Rs.5,00,000/&#126; in the third week of March; accordingly, the complainant presented the said cheque on 20.03.2010 in Bank of India, Saibaba Colony Branch, but it was dishonoured and returned unpaid with the endorsement \u0093Funds Insufficient\u0094 vide bank&#45;s return memo (Ex&#126;P2) dated 22.03.2010; therefore, the complainant issued a statutory demand notice (Ex&#126;P4) dated 24.03.2010, which was received by the accused on 26.03.2010 vide postal acknowledgement card (Ex&#126;P5); the accused issued a reply notice (Ex&#126;P6) dated 01.04.2010, repudiating the debt; since the complainant did not comply with the demand, the complainant initiated a prosecution in S.T.C.No.551 of 2010 before the Judicial Magistrate No.I, Coimbatore, for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for brevity \u0093the NI Act\u0094), against the accused.\n\n\t4. Before the trial Court, the complainant examined himself as PW1 and marked ten exhibits. \n\n\t5. When the accused was questioned under Section 313 Cr.P.C. on the incriminating circumstances appearing against him, he denied the same and did not give any explanation as to how the cheque executed by him came into the hands of the complainant. On behalf of the accused, two witnesses were examined viz., Singari, Branch Manager, Bank of India, Saibaba Colony Branch, Coimbatore, where the complainant was having his bank account, as DW1 and Athipathi, Assistant Branch Manager, ICICI Bank, Coimbatore, as DW2 and one exhibit was marked.\n\n\t6. After considering the evidence on record and hearing either side, the trial Court, by judgment and order dated 28.02.2012 in S.T.C.No.557 of 2012, convicted the accused of the offence under Section 138 of the NI Act and sentenced him to undergo one year simple imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/&#126;, in default to undergo one month simple imprisonment.\n\n\t7. The appeal in C.A.No.104 of 2012 filed by the accused was dismissed by the IV Additional District and Sessions Court (Fast Track Court No.II), Coimbatore, on 05.09.2012.\n\n\t8. Aggrieved by the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below, the accused has preferred the present revision invoking Section 397 r/w 401 Cr.P.C.\n\n\t9. At the time of admission, this Court, by judgment and order dated 29.10.2012 in M.P.Nos.1 & 2 of 2012 in Crl.R.C.No.1335 of 2012, suspended the sentence and directed release of the accused on bail, pending disposal of the revision petition without he surrendering.\n\n\t10. On 02.12.2019, this Court passed the following order:\n\t\u0093Today, when the matter was taken up for hearing, learned counsel appearing for the revision petitioner submitted that he has no instructions and that he has also withdrawn the vakalat.\n\n\tTherefore, Registry is directed to print the name of the revision petitioner in the cause list and post the matter on 03.12.2019.\u0094\n\n\t11. On 03.12.2019, this Court passed the following order: \n\t\u0093When the matter was taken up for hearing on 02.12.2019, counsel for the revision petitioner submitted that he has no instructions and that he has also withdrawn the vakalat. Therefore, this Court directed the Registry to print the name of the revision petitioner in the cause list on 03.12.2019.\n\n\t2. Accordingly, the name of the revision petitioner is printed in the cause list today. His name was called thrice by the Office Assistant of this Court. The petitioner has not made any arrangement to enter appearance.\n\n\n\t3. This Court can cancel the suspension of sentence and bail that has been granted to the revision petitioner, which extreme step, this Court does not want to take. Hence, this Court appoints Mr.S.Suresh (Enrollment No.1372/2004), Advocate of more than 10 years standing, to appear for the revision petitioner. Copy of Typed Set of Papers is furnished to Mr.S.Suresh.\n\t4. Post the matter on 06.12.2019 for final hearing.\u0094\n\t\n\t12. Heard Mr.S.Suresh, learned counsel for the accused and Mr.A.Thiyagarajan, learned counsel for the complainant.\n\n\t13. Before adverting to the rival submissions, it may be necessary to state here that while exercising revisional jurisdiction in a case involving concurrent findings of fact arrived at by two Courts below, the High Court cannot act as a second appellate Court [See State of Maharashtra vs. Jagmohan Singh Kuldip Singh Anand and Others, etc.1]. Very recently, in Bir Singh vs. Mukesh Kumar2, the Supreme Court has held as under:\n\t\u009317. As held by this Court in Southern Sales & Services v. Sauermilch Design and Handels GmbH [Southern Sales & Services v. Sauermilch Design and Handels GmbH, (2008) 14 SCC 457] , it is a well&#126;established principle of law that the Revisional Court will not interfere even if a wrong order is passed by a court having jurisdiction, in the absence of a jurisdictional error. .... \u0094                                                (emphasis supplied)\n\t\n\t14. The learned counsel for the accused submitted that the accused had discharged the burden under Section 139 of the NI Act and has established that the impugned cheque was not issued towards any \u0093legally enforceable debt\u0094. He also submitted that both the Courts below have failed to appreciate the evidence of Singari (DW1) and Athipathi (DW2), in the proper perspective. \n\n\t15. Per contra, the learned counsel for the complainant refuted the submissions made by the learned counsel for the accused.\n\n\t16. The complainant, who, examined himself as PW1, has spoken to about the loan of Rs.10,00,000/&#126; that was taken by the accused, the issuance of the three cheques, their initial dishonour, the payment of Rs.5,00,000/&#126; by the accused, the return of the two cheques to the accused on such payment, re&#126;presentation of the cheque (Ex&#126;P1) for a sum of Rs.5,00,000/&#126; on 20.03.2010, its dishonour on 22.03.2010, the issuance of the statutory demand notice (Ex&#126;P4) dated 24.03.2010, the receipt of the same by the accused on 26.03.2010 vide postal acknowledgment card (Ex&#126;P5), the reply notice (Ex&#126;P6) dated 26.03.2010 sent by the accused and the failure of the accused to comply with the demand. \n\n\t17. The contention of the accused is that he had taken only Rs.5,00,000/&#126; as loan, which he had discharged and the impugned cheque (Ex&#126;P1) for Rs.5,00,000/&#126; was misused by the complainant. \n\n\t18. The complainant has established that the impugned cheque (Ex&#126;P1) for the sum of Rs.5,00,000/&#126; was presented once on 27.01.2010 along with the other two cheques for Rs.2,00,000/&#126; and Rs.3,00,000/&#126;. All the three cheques were dishonoured, after which, the accused paid Rs.5,00,000/&#126; and took back the two cheques for Rs.2,00,000/&#126; and Rs.3,00,000/&#126;. The complainant re&#126;presented the third cheque only on 22.03.2010. \n\n\n\t19. Moreover, the accused has not denied his signature in the impugned cheque (Ex&#126;P1). Had the accused taken only Rs.5,00,000/&#126; as loan and discharged it, he would have taken steps to get back the impugned cheque (Ex&#126;P1) or would have given \u0093Stop Payment\u0094 instruction, but, he did neither.\n\n\t20. In fact, in the cross&#126;examination of Singari (DW1), the complainant has marked Exs&#126;P8, P9 and P10, to show the transactions he has had with the accused. Thus, the accused himself has bolstered the case of the complainant by examining the Branch Manager of Bank of India, Saibaba Colony Branch, Coimbatore, where the complainant was having his bank account, as DW1. \n\n\t21. Though the accused can discharge the burden under Section 139 of the NI Act by preponderance of probability as held by the Supreme Court in Rangappa Vs. Sri Mohan3, even that has not been done in this case. \n\n\t22. In such perspective of the matter, this Court does not find any infirmity or perversity in the judgments and orders passed by the Courts below, warranting interference.\n\n\tIn the result, this criminal revision is dismissed as being devoid of merits. The trial Court is directed to secure the accused and commit him to prison to serve out the remaining period of sentence. Liberty is given to the parties to approach the trial Court under Section 147, ibid., even after the accused is taken into custody. In the event of the matter being compounded under Section 147, ibid., the Magistrate shall send a report to the Assistant Registrar (Crl. Section) of this Court, who shall make it form part of the records in Crl.R.C.No.1335  of 2012. If any amount has been deposited by the accused either in the appellate Court or in the trial Court in connection with this case, the same shall be disbursed with accrued interest to the complainant or to his legal heirs, as the case may be.\n\n\n\t 06.12.2019\nnsd\n\n\nP.N.PRAKASH, J.\nnsd\n\n\nTo\n\n1.

By way of the present judgment, I am disposing of a Civil Revision Petition being CRP No. 48/2000 and a Civil Contempt Petition being Cont. Cas.(C) 557/2008 as facts are common to both the proceedings.\n2. The CRP No. 48/2008 has been filed under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as 'CPC'), by Mrs. Santosh Kapoor seeking setting aside of the order dated 12th February, 2008 passed by the Additional District Judge, Delhi in RCA No. 16 of 2007 as well as quashing of order dated 11th December, 2006 passed by Civil Judge, Delhi in Execution Case No. M-7/2004, whereby Mrs. Santosh Kapoor's objection application to the warrants of attachment with respect to DDA Flat No. C- 58C, Shalimar Bagh (hereinafter referred to as 'DDA flat') was dismissed.\n\n3. Cont. Cas.(C) No. 557/2008 has been filed by the Apex Computers against Mr. Rajiv Kapoor, son of Mrs. Santosh Kapoor under Article 215 of the Constitution and Sections 10 and 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act alleging willful breach by Mr. Rajiv Kapoor of undertakings given to the Courts on 7th December, 2002, 24th February, 2003 and 3rd September, 2004.\n\n4. Briefly stated the material facts are that M/s Apex Computers Pvt. Ltd. filed a suit against M/s Welcome Enterprises for recovery of Rs. 1,61,977/- along with pendent lite interest and future interest at the rate of 21% per annum. Since despite service defendant did not enter appearance, defendant was proceeded ex parte and the suit was decreed for a sum of Rs. 1,61,977/- together with interest thereon at the rate of 15 % per annum from the date of filing of the suit till realization. It is pertinent to mention that admittedly Mr. Rajiv Kapoor is the sole proprietor of M/s. Welcome Enterprises and that the suit for recovery was based on dishonoured cheques.\n\n5. In proceedings filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, Mr. Rajiv Kapoor on 7th December, 2002 undertook to pay Rs.1,50,000/- by 3rd February, 2003 to M/s Apex Computers Pvt. Ltd. On such an undertaking being given by Mr. Rajiv Kapoor, M/s Apex Computers Pvt. Ltd. undertook not to execute the civil decree against him.\n\n6. As Mr. Rajiv Kapoor failed to make payment by 3rd February, 2003, the Additional Sessions Judge (in short 'ASJ') forfeited his bail bond and issued non-bailable warrants against him.\n\n7. On Mr. Rajiv Kapoor furnishing a pay order of Rs. 30,000/-, the ASJ on 24th February, 2003 gave time to Mr. Rajiv Kapoor till 30th September, 2003 to settle the dispute with M/s Apex Computers Pvt. Ltd. in accordance with the order dated 7th December, 2002. In the said order Mr. Rajiv Kapoor undertook to pay interest at the rate of 8% on the outstanding amount of Rs. 1,20,000/- from the said date.\n\n8. This Court on 26th September, 2003 by an ex parte order allowed a Criminal Misc. (M) Petition filed by Mr. Rajiv Kapoor and set aside the order dated 3rd February, 2003 as well as the subsequent orders passed by the ASJ for procuring the presence of accused Mr. Rajiv Kapoor.\n\n9. However, in execution proceedings filed by M/s Apex Computers Pvt. Ltd., Mr. Rajiv Kapoor on 20th August, 2004 agreed to pay a sum of Rs. 1,70,000/- in full and final settlement of the decree. Mr. Rajiv Kapoor further agreed before the Civil Judge to give post-dated cheques totaling to Rs. 1,70,000/- on the next date of hearing. On such a statement being made by Mr. Rajiv Kapoor, M/s Apex Computers Pvt. Ltd. undertook not to press the criminal proceedings filed by them against Mr. Rajiv Kapoor.\n\n10. In accordance with the aforesaid undertaking, Mr. Rajiv Kapoor furnished twelve post-dated cheques amounting to Rs. 1,70,000/-. In fact, on 3rd September, 2004, Mr. Rajiv Kapoor undertook on solemn oath before the Civil Judge that all the twelve post-dated cheques given by him would be honoured on the respective dates of their encashment and \"that in case any of the cheques given by me (Rajiv Kapoor) today in court gets dishonoured, I (Rajiv Kapoor) shall be liable to make payment of entire decreetal amount along with interest.\"\n\n11. Mr. Rajiv Kapoor vide his letter dated 29th September, 2004 requested M/s Apex Computers Pvt. Ltd. to deposit the first post-dated cheque on 15th October, 2004 instead of 30th September, 2004 on the ground that he had to bear some unforeseen expense on account of his mother's ailment. M/s Apex Computers Pvt. Ltd. accepted the request of Mr. Rajiv Kapoor and delayed the deposit of the cheques.\n\n12. But when the cheques were presented on 15th October, 2004, they were dishonoured by the Bank on the ground of insufficient funds. Upon dishonour of the first two cheques, M/s Apex Computers Pvt. Ltd. once again revived the execution proceedings and on 6th May, 2005, the Executing Court issued warrants of attachment against the immovable property of Mr. Rajiv Kapoor.\n\n13. On 5th July, 2005, Mr. Rajiv Kapoor's mother Smt. Santosh Kapoor filed an objection application on the ground that Mr. Rajiv Kapoor had left her house and she had disowned her son vide public notice dated 2nd July, 2005. In the said application, it was prayed that the Executing Court should not issue any warrants in respect of the premises being DDA flat which belonged to her. However, the Executing Court vide its order dated 11th December, 2006 dismissed Smt. Santosh Kapoor's application on the ground that she had nowhere stated that Mr. Rajiv Kapoor did not have any right, title or interest in the immovable property at Shalimar Bagh. The Executing Court further held that Smt. Santosh Kapoor had not filed any title deed showing her title in the property despite the fact that M/s Apex Computers Pvt. Ltd. had taken the stand that Mr. Rajiv Kapoor was the absolute owner of the DDA flat as the said property stood in the name of his father.\n\n14. In October, 2006, M/s Apex Computers Pvt. Ltd. also filed a contempt petition before the Executing Court against Mr. Rajiv Kapoor.\n\n15. Smt. Santosh Kapoor filed an application for review before the Executing Court on the ground that she was owner of DDA flat by virtue of a Will left behind by her husband. However, the said review application was also dismissed by the Executing Court on 12th May, 2007 on the ground that the title of Smt. Santosh Kapoor with respect of the said property had already been decided by it, while disposing of her initial objection application.\n\n16. On 7th July, 2007 upon an application being made by M/s Apex Computers Pvt. Ltd. the Civil Judge corrected a few typographical errors in the order dated 12th May, 2007 and issued fresh warrants of attachment with regard to DDA flat.\n\n17. On 12th February, 2008, Smt. Santosh Kapoor's appeal challenging the Civil Judge's order dated 11th December, 2006 was dismissed by the Additional District Judge (in short 'ADJ') on the ground that the same was barred by limitation and that further on merits no case was made out as the objection application nowhere stated that the property in question did not belong to Mr. Rajiv Kapoor or that Mr. Rajiv Kapoor had no share in the said property.\n\n18. It is pertinent to mention that, in the meantime, Smt. Santosh Kapoor filed a probate petition being PC No. 69 of 2007 claiming to be the exclusive owner of DDA flat on the basis of an alleged unregistered, handwritten Will dated 20th December, 2002 left behind by her husband, Sh. Upinder Nath Kapoor who passed away on 22nd December, 2003. However, the Probate Court vide its judgment and order dated 5th April, 2008 dismissed the said probate case on the ground that Smt. Santosh Kapoor had failed to prove the execution of the alleged Will, in accordance with law. The relevant observations of the Court while dismissing the probate case are reproduced hereinbelow for ready reference:-\n\n\" The mandatory requirement of law is that a will must be attested by two persons. I have perused the original will. It was not executed in the presence of anybody else. There is not even a single attesting witness of the will. Even the petitioner has not proved the signature of the testator on this will. The requirement of due execution of a will under Section 63(c) of the Succession Act is its attestation by two or more witnesses. There is not even a single attesting witness of this will hence it is no will in the eyes of law. Even if it is a handwritten will is not proved because the petitioner has not deposed in her affidavit that this will was executed in her presence or it was signed by Upinder Nath Kapoor in her presence. She has not even identified the signature of Upinder Nath Kapoor on this will. No other evidence was lead by the petitioner and respondent preferred not to lead any evidence in this case. Even if the entire affidavit filed by the petitioner is admitted as a gospel truth, the petitioner has failed to prove the execution of the will as per law. Hence the petition is hereby dismissed.\"\n19. In the meantime, M/s Apex Computers Pvt. Ltd. withdrew the contempt petition which they had filed before the Executing Court and filed a fresh contempt petition being Cont. Cas.(C) No. 557 of 2008 before this Court alleging that Mr. Rajiv Kapoor had deliberately and willfully breached his own undertaking given on 3rd February, 2003 and on various other dates before the Executing Court and the Criminal Court.\n\n20. As far as the civil revision petition filed by Smt. Santosh Kapoor is concerned, it is an admitted position that DDA flat initially belonged to Sh. Upinder Nath Kapoor. Since the probate petition filed by Smt. Santosh Kapoor has been dismissed, I am of the view that at this stage I will have to proceed on the basis that there is no Will executed by Sh. Upinder Nath Kapoor. Consequently, in accordance with the Succession Act, the property of Late Sh. Upinder Nath Kapoor would devolve upon all his legal heirs in equal share which would include his wife Smt. Santosh Kapoor, his son Mr. Rajiv Kapoor and three daughters. The share of Mr. Rajiv Kapoor would only be one-fifth in the DDA flat and, therefore, to the extent of Mr. Rajiv Kapoor's share which is one-fifth undivided share in the said flat, I confirm the attachment order.\n\n21. Learned counsel for Mr. Rajiv Kapoor advanced two defences in the contempt petition. He firstly submitted that breach of an undertaking can never amount to a contempt. Secondly, he submitted that the present contempt petition filed by M/s Apex Computers Pvt. Ltd was barred by limitation as the same was based on an undertaking given to the Executing Court on 3rd September, 2004 whereas admittedly the present contempt petition was filed in this Court on 18th September, 2008 and even if the initial contempt filed before the Executing Court in October, 2006 was taken into account, then also the contempt petition would be barred by limitation, as under Section 20 of the Contempt of Courts Act, a contempt petition has to be filed within one year from the date on which the contempt is alleged to have been committed - which according to him happened in September 2004. In this connection he relied upon judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ompraksh Jaiswal vs. D.K. Mittal and Anr. reported in (2000) 3 SCC 171 wherein it has been held as under :-\n\n\"18. In the case at hand the order which was passed on 15-1-1987 had called upon the respondents only to show cause why contempt proceedings be not initiated. After the cause was shown the Court was to make up its mind whether to initiate or not to initiate proceedings for contempt. It was not an initiation of proceedings. We will ignore the order dated 16-2-1987 as it was not signed. But the order dated 6-1-1988 issuing notices to the opposite parties to show cause why they be not punished for disobeying the order dated 9-12-1986, shows and it will be assumed that the Court had applied its mind to the facts and material placed before it and had formed an opinion that a case for initiating proceedings for contempt was made out. Need for issuance of such notices was conceded to by the Advocate General as also by the counsel for the respondents. That is why it directed the respondents to be called upon to show cause why they be not punished for disobedience of the order of the Court. The proceedings were therefore initiated on 6-1-1988 and were within the limitation prescribed by Section 20 of the Act. The impugned order directing dropping of the proceedings is based on an erroneous view of Section 20 of the Act and hence is liable to be set aside.\n22. Learned Counsel for Mr. Kapoor also referred to Rajni Rani Gupta vs. Babu Ram and Ors. reported in (2001) 58 DRJ 206 wherein it has been held as under :-\n\n\"2. Under Section 20 of the Contempt of Court Act, no Court shall initiate any proceedings for contempt, either on its own motion or otherwise, after the expiry of a period of one year from the date on which the contempt is alleged to have been committed. In the present case, according to the petitioner, the contempt was allegedly committed in early 1994 when the property was sold by respondents 1 & 2 to respondent No. 3. The Supreme Court in a recent judgment in Om Parkash Jaiswal v. D.K. Mittal and Anr., has held that proceedings in accordance with the provisions of Section 20 of the Act can be said to have been initiated only when the Court forms an opinion by an application of mind that a prima facie case of initiation of proceedings is made out and accordingly issues notice to the alleged contemner to show cause why he be not punished for contempt. It was further held by the Court that mere issuance of notice calling upon the alleged contemner to show cause why contempt proceedings be not initiated would not amount to initiation of proceedings for contempt for the purpose of Section 20. Since in the present case only a notice calling upon the alleged contemner to show cause why contempt proceedings be not initiated has been issued, this case is fully covered by the judgment of the Supreme Court. A period of more than one year has already passed from the alleged commission of contempt and this petition in view of the judgment of the Supreme Court is clearly barred by Section 20 of the Act and the same is accordingly dismissed.\"\n23. In my opinion, breach of an undertaking given to a Court amounts to contempt as would be apparent from the categorical and explicit definition of 'Civil Contempt' under Section 2(b) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. The said Act defines civil contempt as under :-\n\n\"2. Definitions.- In this Act.............\n(b) \"civil contempt\" means willful disobedience to any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a Court or willful breach of an undertaking given to a Court;\"\n(emphasis supplied)\n24. Even the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bank of Baroda v. Sadruddin Hasan Daya & Anr., reported in (2004) 1 SCC 360 has placed this issue beyond controversy by holding as under :-\n\"14. The respondents had filed consent terms in this Court but the same contained an undertaking that they would not alienate, encumber or charge the properties to anyone until the decree was satisfied. Acting upon this undertaking and the consent terms, this Court passed the decree whereunder the respondents (defendants) were given the facility of depositing the amount in eight quarterly installments commencing from 1st November. 1999 to 1st August, 2001. This Court, therefore, put its imprimatur upon the consent terms and made it a decree of the Court. The violation or breach of the undertaking which became part of the decree of the Court certainly amounts to contempt of Court, irrespective of the fact that it is open to the decree holder to execute the decree. Contempt is a matter between the Court and the alleged contemner and is not affected in any manner by the rights or obligations of the parties to the litigation inter se.\"\n(emphasis supplied)\n25. As far as the defence with regard to limitation is concerned, the two judgments referred to and relied upon by the learned Counsel for petitioner stand overruled in the case of Pallav Sheth vs. Custodian and Ors. reported in (2001) 7 SCC 549 wherein it has been held as under :-\n\"42. The decision in Om Prakash Jaiswal's case (supra), to the effect that initiation of proceedings under Section 20 can only be said to have occurred when the Court formed the prima facie opinion that contempt has been committed and issued notice to the contemner to show-cause why it should not be punished, is taking too narrow a view of Section 20 which does not seem to be warranted and is not only going to cause hardship but would perpetrate injustice. A provision like Section 20 has to be interpreted having regard to the realities of the situation. For instance, in a case where a contempt of a subordinate court is committed a report is prepared whether on an application to Court or otherwise, and reference made by the subordinate court to the High Court. It is only thereafter that a High Court can take further action under Section 15. In the process, more often than not, a period of one year elapses. If the interpretation of Section 20 put in Om Prakash Jaiswal's case (supra) is correct, it would mean that notwithstanding both the subordinate court and the High Court being prima facie satisfied that contempt has been committed the High Court would become powerless to take any action. On the other hand, if the filing of an application before the subordinate court or the High Court making of a reference by a subordinate court on its own motion or the filing an application before an Advocate-General for permission to initiate contempt proceedings is regarded as initiation by the Court for the purposes of Section 20, then such an interpretation would not impinge on or stultify the power of the High Court to punish for contempt which power, dehors the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 is enshrined in Article 215 of the Constitution. Such an interpretation of Section 20 would harmonise that section with the powers of the Courts to punish for contempt which is recognised by the Constitution.\"\n(emphasis supplied)\n26. Moreover, I am of the view that failure to pay the amount undertaken, amounts to a contempt which in a situation of this nature is a continuous wrong. Therefore, in my view, the present contempt petition is not barred by limitation as prescribed in Section 20 of the Contempt of Courts, Act. In this connection, the following observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Firm Ganpat Ram Rajkumar v. Kalu Ram & Ors., reported in AIR 1989 SC 2285, are relevant:-\n\"7. Another point was taken about limitation of this application under Section 20 of the Act. Section 20 states that no court shall initiate any proceedings for contempt, either on its own motion or otherwise, after the expiry of a period of one year from the date on which the contempt is alleged to have been committed. In this case, the present application was filed on or about 3rd November, 1988 as appears from the affidavit in support of the application. The contempt consisted, inter alia, of the act of not giving the possession by force of the order of the learned Sr. Sub- Judge, Narnaul dated 3rd November, 1988. Therefore, the application was well within the period of one year.\nFailure to give possession, if it amounts to a contempt in a situation of this nature is a continuing wrong. There was no scope for application of Section 20 of the Act.\"\n(emphasis supplied)\n27. In fact, from the aforementioned facts, I am of the view that right from the inception Mr. Rajiv Kapoor had no intention of paying any amount and he agreed for a settlement and gave post-dated cheques as well as repeated undertakings, including the last one on 3rd September, 2004, only with the intent of gaining time and delaying the execution proceedings. Mr. Rajiv Kapoor intentionally and deliberately adopted such a course of action, despite having the option of selling at least his share of the DDA flat in order to comply with his undertaking. Consequently, I am of the opinion that it is a clear case of willful breach of an undertaking given to the Executing Court and I hold the petitioner guilty of contempt and I list the matter for arguments on sentence on 9th March, 2009.\nMANMOHAN, J January 28, 2009"

Petitioner is the accused in the Calendar  Case,\n\nwhich  was  taken  on file on the complaint  lodged  by  the\n\nrespondent/complainant, on the strength of  dishonour  of  a\n\ncheque,  reportedly issued by the petitioner on  31.07.2004,\n\nfor a sum of Rs.45,000/-.\n\n\n\n        3.  The  Judicial Magistrate, after considering  the\n\noral evidence on record, found the petitioner guilty of  the\n\noffence under Section 138 of The Negotiable Instruments Act,\n\nin  short 'the Act', slapping a fine of Rs.3,000/-  and,  in\n\ndefault  of payment, to undergo simple imprisonment for  six\n\nmonths,  also  directing him to pay a sum of Rs.25,000/-  as\n\ncompensation  to the respondent/complainant,  under  Section\n\n357 (3) Cr.P.C.\n\n\n\n        4.  Not satisfied with the sentence imposed  on  the\n\naccused,  the  complainant preferred a revision  before  the\n\nPrincipal  Sessions  Court,  Erode,  in  Criminal   Revision\n\nPetition  No.83  of  2006, for enhancement  of  sentence  of\n\ncompensation.  On  going through the  facts,  the  Principal\n\nSessions   Judge   allowed  the  revision,   enhancing   the\n\ncompensation from Rs.25,000/- to Rs.65,000/- and, in default\n\nof  payment, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one  year,\n\nunder Section 397 Cr.P.C.\n\n\n\n\n\n        5.  The  accused  has  carried  the  said  order  of\n\nenhancement of compensation in revision before this Court.\n\n\n\n        6.  In order to get enlightened about the nature  of\n\nrelief  to  be  awarded by the Courts below and  the  relief\n\nconsidered  by  this  Court,  a  perusal  of  the   relevant\n\nprovision, namely, Section 397 Cr.P.C. is inevitable,  which\n\nreads as under :\n\n           \n           \"397.  Calling for records to  exercise\n           powers of revision.-\n\n                    (1)  The  High  Court  or  any\n           Sessions   Judge  may  call   for   and\n           examine  the  record of any  proceeding\n           before  any  inferior  Criminal   Court\n           situate   within  its  or   his   local\n           jurisdiction   for   the   purpose   of\n           satisfying itself or himself as to  the\n           correctness,  legality or propriety  of\n           any   finding,   sentence   or   order,\n           recorded  or  passed,  and  as  to  the\n           regularity of any proceedings  of  such\n           inferior  Court, and may, when  calling\n           for   such  record,  direct  that   the\n           execution of any sentence or  order  be\n           suspended,  and if the  accused  is  in\n           confinement,  that he  be  released  on\n           bail  or  on  his own bond pending  the\n           examination of the record.\n           \n           \n                   Explanation.- All  Magistrates,\n           whether  Executive  or  Judicial,   and\n           whether    exercising    original    or\n           appellate   jurisdiction,   shall    be\n           deemed  to be inferior to the  Sessions\n           Judge  for  the purpose  of  this  sub-\n           section and of Section 398.\n\n                  (2) xxx\n\n                  (3) xxx\"\n\n\n        7. Revisional powers of the High Court are very wide\n\nbut are purely discretionary and exercisable only when there\n\nis a glaring defect in the procedure and a manifest error on\n\npoint  of law, leading to miscarriage of justice.  The power\n\nof revision is to be exercised only for correcting injustice\n\nand not mere illegality, which may not go to the root of the\n\ncase.   The  interference of Court in revision is justified,\n\nif  the decision rendered by the Court below is patently  or\n\ngrossly  erroneous  or  there  is  no  compliance  with  the\n\nprovisions  of  law  and when there is a  violation  of  the\n\nstatutory requirements. As adverted to supra, the revisional\n\njurisdiction of the High Court must be exercised,  if  there\n\nis  any glaring defect in the procedure or manifest error on\n\npoint  of  law,  resulting  in  a  flagrant  miscarriage  of\n\njustice.\n\n\n\n        8.  Now,  the matter has to be looked into,  in  the\n\nbackdrop  of  the  above said principles laid  down  in  the\n\nilluminating judicial pronouncements.\n\n\n\n        9.  The  Principal Sessions Judge has justified  the\n\nenhancement  of  compensation  in  his  order,  saying  that\n\nconsidering the cheque amount, the compensation  awarded  by\n\nthe   trial   Court  was  not  adequate  and   it   required\n\nenhancement,  for  the purpose of achieving  the  object  of\n\nSection  138  of  the Act.  He also followed the  principles\n\nlaid  down  in various decisions of the High Court  and  the\n\nSupreme  Court.   He further referred to a decision  of  the\n\nHimachal  Pradesh High Court in Pran Nath Tikku v. Rajirider\n\nMaheswari, 2004 Cri.L.J.3772, in which it was concluded that\n\nthe  Sessions  Judge  is empowered to enhance  the  sentence\n\nunder  Section  397 Cr.P.C.  Also, he quoted a  decision  of\n\nthis  Court in M/s.Sasi Polycolours  v. M/s.Lakshmi Polymers\n\n&  Others, 2006 Cri.L.J. 2489, in which it was observed that\n\nin  order to avoid delay and multiplicity of litigation, the\n\nsentence  of compensation of twice the amount of the  cheque\n\nhad to be awarded, in exercise of revisional powers.\n\n\n\n        10.  Learned counsel for the petitioner  would  draw\n\nattention  of  this Court to a decision in  Suganthi  Suresh\n\nKumar v. Jegadeesan, 2001 (3) CTC 29,  in which it was  held\n\nthat  this Court can only alter the nature or the extent  of\n\nsentence or alter the nature and the extent of sentence, but\n\nfresh  compensation cannot be awarded, while exercising  the\n\npowers   of  revision  under  Section  401  Cr.P.C.,   which\n\nenvisages  exercise of powers under Section 386 Cr.P.C.   It\n\nleads  to  a  logical conclusion that the High Court  or   a\n\nrevisional Court cannot impose fresh compensation, when  the\n\nJudicial  Magistrate has not awarded any  compensation,  but\n\nthe facts of the case on hand are distinguishable.\n\n\n\n        11.  Learned counsel for the petitioner also  places\n\nreliance upon a decision of the Supreme Court in Mangilal v.\n\nState  of  Madhya Pradesh, 2004 (1) MWN (Cr.)  (SC)  69,  in\n\nwhich it is held as follows :\n\n           \n                   \"12.  The  use of the expression\n           \"may\"  throws  light on the  legislative\n           intent  in the context it is  used.   It\n           has  been used in the permissible  sense\n           and does not make it obligatory.  In the\n           aforesaid   background,  the  inevitable\n           conclusion  is  that  if  the  Appellate\n           Court intends to award compensation,  an\n           opportunity of hearing has to be granted\n           so  that  the relevant aspects like  the\n           need to award compensation, capacity  of\n           the  accused  to pay and  several  other\n           relevant factors can be taken note of.\"\n\n\n\n        12. The Apex Court has laid down a dictum that while\n\nfixing  quantum  of compensation, the accused  ought  to  be\n\nheard  and  non-observation of  the  procedure  would  be  a\n\nviolation  of  principles of natural justice.  But,  in  the\n\npresent  case,  no  such  circumstance  is  available.   The\n\nPrincipal  Sessions Judge passed orders, only after  hearing\n\nboth  sides,  and  rendered a finding that  considering  the\n\ncheque amount and the object of Section 138 of the  Act, the\n\nenhancement  of  compensation  was  unavoidable.   The  said\n\nfinding,  in my view, is in accordance with law.  Therefore,\n\nthe decision aforecited is of no avail to the petitioner.\n\n\n\n        13.  Conversely, learned counsel for the  respondent\n\ngarnered  support  from a decision of the Supreme  Court  in\n\nPankajbhai  Nagjibhai  Patel  v.  State  of  Gujarat,   2001\n\nCRI.L.J.950,   wherein the Apex Court had  referred  to  its\n\nprevious judgment and reached a conclusion that a Magistrate\n\ncan award any sum, as compensation.  The relevant portion of\n\nthe said decision goes thus :\n\n\n                    \"16....Even  that   apart,   a\n           Magistrate who thinks it fit  that  the\n           complainant  must  be compensated  with\n           his  loss  he can resort to the  course\n           indicated  in Section 357 of the  Code.\n           This  aspect  has been  dealt  with  in\n           Bhaskaran's case (supra) as follows :\n\n\n                            'However,    the\n                 Magistrate  in  such  cases\n                 can      alleviate      the\n                 grievance      of       the\n                 complainant    by    making\n                 resort  to Section 357  (3)\n                 of  the  Code.  It is  well\n                 to   remember   that   this\n                 Court  has  emphasised  the\n                 need   for  making  liberal\n                 use   of   that   provision\n                 (Hari   Singh  v.   Sukhbir\n                 Singh,  1988 (4) SCC  551).\n                 No  limit  is mentioned  in\n                 the     sub-section     and\n                 therefore,   a   Magistrate\n                 can   award  any   sum   as\n                 compensation.   Of   course\n                 while  fixing  the  quantum\n                 of  such compensation,  the\n                 Magistrate has to  consider\n                 what    would    be     the\n                 reasonable    amount     of\n                 compensation   payable   to\n                 the   complainant.    Thus,\n                 even   if  the  trial   was\n                 before    a    Court     of\n                 Magistrate  of  the   first\n                 class  in  respect   of   a\n                 cheque   which  covers   an\n                 amount exceeding Rs.5,000/-,\n                 the   Court  has  power  to\n                 award  compensation  to  be\n                 paid to the complainant.'\n           \n                   17.  In our view, this question\n           does   not   now  pose  any   practical\n           difficulty.  Whenever a  Magistrate  of\n           the   first   class  feels   that   the\n           complainant  should be compensated,  he\n           can,   after   imposing   a   term   of\n           imprisonment, award compensation to the\n           complainant,  for  which  no  limit  is\n           prescribed in Section 357 of the Code.\"\n\n\n        14.  The  above said decisions on the subject  would\n\nclearly  go  to  show  that certain procedures  have  to  be\n\nadopted, while fixing or enhancing the compensation  by  the\n\nJudicial  Magistrate, the first being that both the  parties\n\nparticularly the accused shall be afforded ample opportunity\n\nof being heard; secondly, the other circumstance, namely, in\n\nthe  like  nature of cases, the quantum referred to  in  the\n\ncheque  and, nextly, the objects of Section 138 of the  Act,\n\nnot to be defeated.\n\n\n\n        15.  Inasmuch as the order under challenge, the same\n\nwas   passed   by  the  Principal  Sessions   Judge,   after\n\nconsidering  the above aspects and following the  guidelines\n\nformulated  in  the  authoritative judicial  pronouncements.\n\nHence,  this Court does not find any manifest error  or  any\n\nmiscarriage  of  justice in the said order. The  enhancement\n\nordered  by  the  Principal Sessions Court, Erode,  is  well\n\nwithin  the  four  corners  of law  and  the  same  deserves\n\nconfirmation.\n\n\n\n         16.   For  the  foregoing  reasons,  this  Criminal\n\nRevision  Case  is dismissed.  No costs.  Consequently,  the\n\nconnected Crl.M.P.Nos.1 and 3 of 2007 stand closed.\n\n\n\n\n\ndixit\n\n\n"

The appeal is filed\nagainst the order of  acquittal of the 2nd respondent\nherein.  The above case is filed by the appellant\nbefore the lower Court against respondent No.1 and 2 to\nprosecute them under section 138 of the Negotiable\nInstruments Act (hereinafter, the parties are mentioned\nin accordance to their rank before the trial Court).\n\n        2.  The case of the complainant in brief is as\nfollows:-\n        The complainant is engaged in the business of\ntransporting containers and hiring  trailer lorries for\ntransporting. According to the complainant, the accused\nissued a cheque drawn on M/s.Federal Bank Ltd. dated\n26.06.1999  for  Rs.1,96,000/-  in  favour  of  the\ncomplainant for discharging the liability incurred in\nthe business.  The cheque was presented for encashment,CRL.A.No.1634 OF 2005           3\n\nit        was         dishonored                with          an        endorsement                 'fund\ninsufficient'.  When a statutory notice was issued, the\naccused refused to pay the amount. Hence, the complaint\nwas filed.\n\n        3.       To substantiate the case, one witness was\nexamined on side of the prosecution. Exts. P1 to P6 are\nthe       exhibits.             On       going         through           the        evidence            and\ndocuments, the trial Court found that, the 1st accused\nis      guilty of the offence under Section 138 of the\nNegotiable Instruments Act.  Since, the 1st accused is a\nfirm, an amount of Rs.5,000/- was imposed as fine. The\n2nd accused was found not guilty and he was acquitted.\nAgainst the acquittal order of the 2nd                                             accused, this\nCriminal Appeal is filed by the complainant.\n\n        4.       Heard          both         sides.           The         counsel            for        the\ncomplainant submitted that, the order of acquittal of\nthe 2nd accused in this case is illegal, in the light of\nthe         judgment              of        the         Appex           Court           in       S.M.S.\nPharmaceuticals                  Ltd.         Vs.       Neetha          Bhalla          (2005(4)KLT\n209 ). According to the counsel, the 2nd accused is the\nManaging Partner of the firm. He signed the cheque onCRL.A.No.1634 OF 2005           4\n\nbehalf of the firm.  Therefore, he is responsible as\nper Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.\n\n        5.  The counsel for the 2nd accused submitted that,\nthe decision in  S.M.S.Pharmaceuticals case (Supra) has\nnot considered the effect of partners in a partnership\nfirm.  According to the counsel, as per the Partnership\nAct, Managing Partner is not defined and hence if a\npartner is implicated as an accused in a criminal\ncomplaint, there should be averments in the complaint\nto the effect that he was in charge of, and was\nresponsible to the firm for the conduct of the business\nof the company, as well as the company. According to\nthe counsel, there is no such averment in the complaint\nand  hence  the  benefit  of  the  decision  of  the\nS.M.S.Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Vs. Neetha Bhalla (Supra) is\nactually in support of his contention.  The learned\ncounsel also cited the decision of the Division Bench\nof this Court in Mymoonath Beevi Vs. State of Kerala\n(2005(4)  KLT) 174.  The  counsel  submitted  that,  the\nDivision Bench of this Court observed in para 12 of the\ndecision  that,the  complaint  should  contain  theCRL.A.No.1634 OF 2005           5\n\nnecessary facts constituting the offence as against the\nperson arranged as the accused.  If there is no such\naverments, according to the counsel, the prosecution is\nnot possible against a partner, even if he is the\nManaging  Partner  of  the  firm.  The  counsel  also\nsubmitted that, no notice is issued to the firm in this\ncase.  He also submitted that the execution of the\ncheque is not proved in this case.\n\n        6.  After hearing both sides, I am not in a\nposition to agree with the contentions of the 2nd\naccused in this case, who is acquitted by the trial\nCourt. S.M.S.Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Supra) is the three\nBench decision of the Supreme Court. Actually the case\nwas referred by a three Bench because of the difference\nof opinion of the other two benches.  The matter was\nreferred to the larger bench for the determination of\nthe following questions.\n\n                a) Whether for purposes of S.141 of the\n                Negotiable  Instruments  Act,  1881,  it  is\n                sufficient if the substance of the allegation\n                read as a whole fulfill  the requirements of\n                the said section and it is not necessary toCRL.A.No.1634 OF 2005           6\n\n                specifically state in the complaint that the\n                persons  accused  was  in  charge  of,  or\n                responsible for, the conduct of the business\n                of the company.\n\n                 (b) Whether a director of a company would be\n                 deemed to be in charge of, and responsible\n                 to, the company for conduct of the business\n                 of the company and, therefore, deemed to be\n                 guilty of the offence unless he proves to the\n                 contrary.\n\n                 (c)  Even  if  it  is  held  that  specific\n                 averments  are  necessary,  whether  in  the\n                 absence of such averments the signatory of\n                 the cheque and or the Managing Directors of\n                 Joint Managing Director who admittedly would\n                 be in charge of the company and responsible\n                 to the company for conduct of its business\n                 could be proceeded against.\n\n        7.  After considering the entire facts and the law\non the subject the larger bench of the Supreme Court\nanswered the point in the following manner.\n\n                 a) It is necessary to specifically aver in a\n                 complaint under S.141 that at the time the\n                 offence was committed, the person accused was\n                 in charge of, and responsible for the conduct\n                 of business of the company.  This averment is\n                 an essential requirement of S.141 and has toCRL.A.No.1634 OF 2005           7\n\n                 be made in a complaint.  Without this averment\n                 being made in a complaint, the requirements of\n                 S.141 cannot be said to be satisfied.\n\n                 (b) The answer to question posed in sub para\n                 (b) has to be in negative.  Merely being a\n                 director of a company is not sufficient to\n                 make the person liable under S.141 of the Act.\n                 A director in a company cannot be deemed to be\n                 in charge of and responsible to the company\n                 for conduct of its business.  The requirement\n                 of S.141 is that the person sought to be made\n                 liable should be in charge of and responsible\n                 for the conduct of the business of the company\n                 at the relevant time.   This has to be averred\n                 as a fact as there is no deemed liability of a\n                 director in such cases.\n\n                 (c)  The answer to question (c) has to be in\n                 affirmative.  The question notes that the\n                 Managing Director  or Joint Managing Director\n                 would be admittedly in charge of the company\n                 and responsible to the company for conduct of\n                 its business.  When that is so, holders of\n                 such positions in a company become liable\n                 under S.141 of the Act. By virtue of the\n                 office they holds Managing Director or Joint\n                 Managing Director, these persons are in charge\n                 of and responsible for the conduct of business\n                 of the company.  Therefore, they get covered\n                 under S.141. So far as signatory of a chequeCRL.A.No.1634 OF 2005           8\n\n                 which  is  dishonored  is  concerned,  he  is\n                 clearly responsible for the incriminating act\n                 and will be covered under sub-s. (2) of S.141.\n\nThe  question(c)refers,  whether  in  the  absence  of\nspecific averments against the signatory of the cheque\nand  or  the  Managing  Directors  or  Joint  Managing\nDirector who admittedly would be in charge of the\ncompany and responsible to the company for the conduct\nof its business could be proceeded against.  The larger\nbench answered this question to the effect that, the\nManaging Director or Joint Managing Director would be\nadmittedly in charge of the company and responsible to\nthe company for  conduct of its business.  When that is\nso, holders of such position in a company become liable\nunder Section 141 of the Act.  By virtue of their\nportion,  they  hold  as  Manging  Director  or  Joint\nManaging Director.  These persons are in charge of and\nresponsible for the conduct of business of the company.\nTherefore, the larger Bench of the Supreme Court held\nthat,  they  get  covered  under  section  141  of  the\nNegotiable Instruments Act.  It is also mentioned in\nthe decision that, signatory of a cheque which isCRL.A.No.1634 OF 2005           9\n\ndishonoured is concerned, he is clearly responsible for\nthe incriminating Act and will be covered under sub\nsection (2) of Section 141.    Admittedly, in this case\n2nd accused is the Managing Director of the firm.  It is\nalso the admitted fact that, he is the signatory in the\ncheque.  He signed the cheque on behalf of the firm.\nIn such circumstances, simply because there is no\naverments in the complaint to the effect that, the\nManaging Partner is in charge and responsible he cannot\nescape from responsibility.  Therefore, the contention\nof the 2nd accused is unsustainable.\n\n        8.  Then the counsel submitted that, the decision\nof the larger bench has not considered the Partnership\nAct and the Appex Court considered only the Companies\nAct.  I cannot agree to the contention of the 2nd\naccused.                Explanation               (a)       to      Section           141       of      the\nNegotiable Instruments Act clearly says that 'Company'\nmeans any body corporate and includes a firm or other\nassociation of individuals.  Explanation (b) says that\n'Director' in relation to a firm means a partner in the\nfirm.  In the light of the above explanation in SectionCRL.A.No.1634 OF 2005           10\n\n141  of the Negotiable Instruments Act, I cannot agree\nwith the counsel for the 2nd accused that the principle\nlaid down in S.M.S.Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Supra)is not\napplicable to a partner of a firm.\n\n        9.  The 2nd accused also contented that there is no\nevidence in this case to prove the execution of the\ncheque.  Therefore, even though this is an appeal\nagainst  the  acquittal,  an  accused  can  take  any\ncontention  in his favour before this Court.  It is an\nadmitted case that, the 1st accused in this case is\nM/s. Sea Wings Shipping & Others, Willingdon Island\nrepresented  by  its  Managing  Partner  Mr.  Varghese\nPhilip.  Mr. Varghese Philip is the 2nd accused.  He is\narrayed as the 2nd accused, because he is the Managing\nPartner.  The 1st accused firm was convicted by the\nTrial  Court  under  Section  138  of  the  Negotiable\nInstruments Act.  Since 1st accused is a firm, only fine\nwas imposed.  The conviction and sentence imposed on\nthe 1st accused is not challenged by the 1st accused.  1St\naccused  is  represented  by  the  2nd                                         accused.                 The\nconviction and sentence imposed on the 1St                                                      accusedCRL.A.No.1634 OF 2005           11\n\nbecame final. In such circumstances, the 2nd accused,\nwho is actually representing the 1st accused cannot\ncontend in an appeal against acquittal of the 2nd\naccused to the effect that, the execution of the cheque\nis not proved, especially when the conviction and\nsentence against the 1st accused under section 138 of\nthe Negotiable Instruments Act became final.\n\n        10.  Hence, I think, the 2nd accused also committed\nan  offence  under  section  138  of  the  Negotiable\nInstruments Act.  The trial Court imposed a fine  of\nRs.5,000/- to the 1st accused because 1st accused is a\npartnership firm.  2nd  accused is the Managing Partner\nof the firm.  The transaction in this case happened in\n1999. The cheque involved in this case is for an amount\nof         Rs.1,96,000/-.                     Considering                  the           fact           and\ncircumstances of the case, I think the payment of\ncompensation to the complainant will serve the purpose,\nwithout sending the 2nd accused to jail.\n\n        11.         Hence, the order of acquittal of the 2nd\nrespondent/               2nd      accused                 as       per        judgment             dated\n28.04.2005 in C.C.No.1160/2002 of the Judicial FirstCRL.A.No.1634 OF 2005           12\n\nClass Magistrate -I, Ernakulam is set aside.\n\n        12.  Hence,  this  appeal  is  allowed.                                               The         2nd\nrespondent/2nd                accused           is      convicted             under         section\n138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. He is sentenced\nto undergo imprisonment till rising of the Court and to\npay a compensation of Rs.1,96,000/-.                                            In default of\npayment of compensation, 2nd                                 respondent will undergo\nsimple imprisonment for 3 months.  If the compensation\nis paid  by the 2nd respondent, the entire amount should\nbe disbursed to the appellant/complainant.\n\nnb                                                               P.V.KUNHIKRISHNAN\n                                                                           JUDGE"

JUSTICE H.S. MADAAN\n\nPresent    : Mr.Atul Goel, Advocate\n                for the petitioners.\n\n                Mr.Dheeraj Jain, Advocate\n                for the respondent.\n\n                ****\n\nH.S. MADAAN, J.\n\n                By way of filing the present petition under Section 482\n\nCr.P.C., petitioner M/s Green Electric and its Proprietor Kunta Sai\n\nKumar, a resident of Hyderabad (Andhra Pradesh) seek quashing of\n\ncomplaint under Sections 138, 141 and 142 of the Negotiable\n\nInstruments Act, 1881(hereinafter referred to as the Act) pending in the\n\nCourt of Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Ludhiana as well as order dated\n\n19.9.2015 vide which the petitioners have been summoned to face trial\n\nand other consequential proceedings arising therefrom.\n\n                According to the petitioners, the complainant M/s HeroCRM-M-9372-2018(O&M)                                -2-\n\nExports, New Delhi which is respondent in this petition had filed a\n\ncomplaint under Section 138 of the Act against the present petitioners,\n\nwhich was pending before Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate at New\n\nDelhi. While the case was at the stage of service of accused, the said\n\nMagistrate returned the complaint to be filed before the Court of\n\ncompetent jurisdiction in view of judgment rendered by the Apex Court\n\nin Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod Versus State of Maharashtra and Anr.\n\nAs a matter of fact the entire dealing between the parties had taken place\n\nat New Delhi. The cheques issued by the petitioner were from the banks\n\nsituated at Hyderabad, which were presented by the respondent with\n\nICICI Bank at Delhi on 6.9.2011. The trial Court at Delhi had earlier\n\nrightly returned the complaint in view of the judgment delivered in\n\nDashrath Rupsingh's case (supra) since the complaint was to be\n\npresented at Hyderabad as cause of action had arisen there because\n\nbanker of the accused has address of that place and cheques were\n\ndishonoured there. However, instead of presenting the complaint afresh\n\nat Hyderabad, it was presented at Ludhiana, that too, after a gap of nine\n\nmonths. Learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Ludhiana, while relying\n\nupon the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Ordinance, 2015\n\naccepted the complaint and vide impugned order dated 19.9.2015\n\nproceeded to summon the petitioner. The Bill relating to  Negotiable\n\nInstruments (Amendment) Ordinance, 2015 was eventually accepted as\n\nNegotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2015 w.e.f. 26.12.2015.\n\nAccording to the Ordinance as well as the Amendment Act, Sub-Section\n\n(2) was inserted in Section 142 of the Principal Act, which reads as\n\nunder:-CRM-M-9372-2018(O&M)                                -3-\n\n        \"(2) The offence under section 138 shall be inquired into and tried\n\n        only by a court within whose local jurisdiction,\u2014\n\n        (a) if the cheque is delivered for collection through an account,\n\n        the branch of the bank where the payee or holder in due course, as\n\n        the case may be, maintains the account, is situated; or\n\n        (b) if the cheque is presented for payment by the payee or holder\n\n        in due course, otherwise through an account, the branch of the\n\n        drawee bank where the drawer maintains the account, is situated.\n\n        Explanation.\u2014 For the purposes of clause (a), where a cheque is\n\n        delivered for collection at any branch of the bank of the payee or\n\n        holder in due course, then, the cheque shall be deemed to have\n\n        been delivered to the branch of the bank in which the payee or\n\n        holder in due course, as the case may be, maintains the account.\"\n\n                Thus, the Court at Ludhiana does not have jurisdiction.\n\nTherefore, the petition be accepted.\n\n                On getting notice, the respondent/complainant appeared and\n\nfiled written reply contesting the petition raising preliminary objections\n\nthat the petition is not maintainable because the petitioners/accused had\n\nan alternative remedy of filing an application under Section 177 Cr.P.C.\n\nbefore the trial Court to agitate the allegations of lack of territorial\n\njurisdiction; that the petitioner have not disclosed that they had filed an\n\napplication under Section 205 Cr.P.C. for exemption from personal\n\nappearance on 5.9.2017 before the trial Court  to which the complainant\n\nhad filed reply and it was pending for adjudication, when order was\n\npassed by this Court granting exemption from personal appearance toCRM-M-9372-2018(O&M)                                -4-\n\nthe petitioner/accused. On merits, the material assertions in the petition\n\nare controverted contending that criminal complaint was rightly filed\n\nbefore Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Ludhiana since that Court has\n\nterritorial jurisdiction; the original complaint and documents were\n\nreturned to the complainant by the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate,\n\nDelhi on 8.9.2015 only and the same were submitted to Judicial\n\nMagistrate Ist Class, Ludhiana on 15.9.2015 i.e. within a week of their\n\nreturn and not after a period of nine months as alleged by the petitioners.\n\nAccording to the respondent-complainant, it maintains bank account\n\nwith ICICI Bank Branch situated in Nehru Sidant Kender, Trust\n\nBuilding, Feroze Gandhi Market, Ludhiana, therefore the jurisdiction in\n\nthis case would be only in the Courts situated at Ludhiana, which is\n\nclear from explanation to Section 142(2) of the Act. Refuting the\n\nremaining assertions made in the petition, the respondent prayed for\n\ndismissal of the petition.\n\n                I have heard learned counsel for the parties besides going\n\nthrough the record and I find little merit in the present petition.\n\n                As the things stand, the action of complainant in filing the\n\ncomplaint in the Court of Judicial Magistrate, Ludhiana does not appear\n\nto be wrong or erroneous. It does not come out that such Court lacks\n\nterritorial jurisdiction to entertain and try the complaint in question.\n\n                The petitioners have rushed to this Court instead of availing\n\nof appropriate remedy in the Courts below. The petitioners should have\n\nagitated the matter with regard to lack of jurisdiction before the trial\n\nMagistrate at Ludhiana and could have brought the alleged delay of nine\n\nmonths in submitting the complaint there but for the reasons best knownCRM-M-9372-2018(O&M)                                -5-\n\nto the petitioner, he did not chose to avail of that remedy.\n\n                        The  petition  being  without  merit  stands  dismissed\n\naccordingly.\n\n                                                                                   (H.S.MADAAN)\n13.2.2020                                                                                  JUDGE\nBrij\n\nWhether reasoned/speaking                                   :           Yes/No\n\nWhether reportable                                          :           Yes/No"

C.C.No.595 of 2003 is a\n\n    prosecution launched by the appellant herein before the trial court\n\n    under Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short\n\n    'N I Act').  The trial court found after appreciation of the evidence on\n\n    record that the accused has successfully rebutted the presumption\n\n    and accordingly acquitted him.  Against the finding of acquittal, the\n\n    complainant is now in appeal before this Court.\n\n            2.       The case of the prosecution in brief are to the following\n\n    effect:-\n\n            A cheque dated 02.09.2001, drawn from State Bank of India,\n\n    Varapetty Branch for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- was issued by the\n\n    accused to the complainant for discharging a previous debt.  The\n\n    cheque was presented at State Bank of India, Ayavana Branch for\n\n    collection.  It was dishonoured for insufficiency funds in the account of\n\n    the accused. A lawyer notice was issued by the complainant on\n\n    12.09.2001 demanding the money covered by the cheque.  The notice\n\n    issued, though accepted by the accused on 29.09.2001, he failed toCRL.A.No.470 OF 2007                 3\n     pay the amount. Thereupon a complaint was filed to launch the\n\n     prosecution under Section 142 N I Act.  On appearance of the\n\n     accused, after furnishing him with the copies of the relevant records,\n\n     particulars of the accusations raised in the complaint were read over\n\n     and explained to him.  He pleaded not guilty.  Accordingly, trial was\n\n     held.\n\n                3.          On the side of the prosecution, the complainant himself\n\n     was examined as PW1 and Exts.P1 to P5 were marked.  On closure of\n\n     the prosecution evidence, the accused was questioned with reference\n\n     to the incriminating evidences brought on record by the complainant\n\n     under Section 313 (1)(b) Cr.P.C.  He denied all the allegations and\n\n     maintained the stand of innocence.\n\n                4.          The       trial      court         has       raised          the      following            points         for\n\n     consideration in the case on hand:-\n\n                        '(1) Whether the cheque issued by the accused was\n                        bounced for  want of sufficient funds in the bank\n                        account of the accused?\n\n                        (2) Whether there was sufficient service of notice?\n\n                        (3) Whether there was a legally enforcible debt or\n                        liability?\n\n                        (4) Sentence or order?'\n\n                 5.         According to the learned counsel, the trial court failed to\n\n      appreciate the evidence in it's proper perspective, but jumped into a\n\n      conclusion that the presumption under Section 139 N I Act isCRL.A.No.470 OF 2007                 4\n    attracted in the case on hand and the accused succeeded in rebutting\n\n    that presumption.  According to him, the judgment under challenge is\n\n    liable to be interfered with, for that reason.\n\n             6.      It has come out in evidence of complainant as PW1 that\n\n    he had a plan to start an Ayurvedic Resort Centre at Munnar and the\n\n    accused agreed to join the venture by providing land support.\n\n    Lateron, he realised that the accused has no landed property in his\n\n    name and therefore he receded from the plan.  According to him,\n\n    Rs.1,00,000/- was given by him to the accused as part of the venture\n\n    without security and though the plan failed,  Rs.1,00,000/-  given was\n\n    not returned by the accused.  According to PW1, the accused issued a\n\n    cheque towards repayment at his residence. It was presented at the\n\n    Bank and dishonoured for want of sufficient funds and therefore, the\n\n    prosecution was launched.\n\n             7.       According to the accused an agreement was executed\n\n    following the proposal to start the Ayurvedic Resort.  According to\n\n    him the disputed cheque was given by him to meet the initial\n\n    expenditure to be incurred for the proposed plan.  According to him,\n\n    on realisation that the complainant did not possess the required\n\n    qualification, he retreated from the proposed plan and the cheque\n\n    given by him to the complainant was not returned.  The accused put\n\n    the above case as suggestion to the complainant during his\n\n    examination as PW1 but he denied the same.\n\n             8.      The accused examined a witness on his side as DW1.CRL.A.No.470 OF 2007                 5\n      According to DW1 he had also a desire to join the proposed plan.\n\n      According to him, he was introduced into the proposed project by the\n\n      complainant as an Ayurvedic Doctor.  According to him, an agreement\n\n      was executed in that regard between him and the complainant. To\n\n      derive money to meet the initial expenditure towards the project they\n\n      decided to have the participation of the accused also in the venture.\n\n      Thus, the accused issued a cheque and the said cheque is the\n\n      disputed one in the case in question.  According to DW1, lateron it\n\n      was realised that the complainant does not have the required\n\n      qualification for the conduct of the Ayurvedic Resort as stated by him\n\n      and accordingly himself and the accused retreated therefrom.\n\n                 9.         DW1           during            cross          examination                 has         stated           that\n\n      Rs.1,00,000/- was given to the complainant at Kaveri Tourist Home,\n\n      Kothamangalam whereas the version of PW1 was that the cheque for\n\n      Rs.1,00,000/- was given to the complainant at his house.\n\n            10.             The version of PW1 that Rs.1,00,000/- was advanced by\n\n      him towards the proposed venture remained controverted.                                                                           A\n\n      suggestion though was put by the accused to PW1 about a totally\n\n      different circumstance, which caused the disputed cheque to reach\n\n      the hands of the complainant, PW1 denied the same. The accused\n\n      failed to adduce evidence on his own to establish his claim.  He had\n\n      examined a witness.  In view of the inconsistent stands taken by DW1\n\n      as to the way in which Ext..P1 drawn from the account of the accused\n\n      reached the hands of complainant itself, his version lost credence andCRL.A.No.470 OF 2007                 6\n    is liable to be discarded.  Though, it has come out in evidence of DW1\n\n    that an agreement was executed as a pre-venture step, it was not\n\n    forthcoming in evidence. Therefore, the case on hand is one where\n\n    the complainant succeeded to establish the execution of the cheque\n\n    and the accused thoroughly failed to rebut the presumption that came\n\n    in the context, to attract in his favour. The trial court, has gone wrong\n\n    in taking a contrary view and thereby acquitting the accused.\n\n            In the result, the appeal is allowed. The judgment under\n\n    challenge is set aside.  The accused  is found guilty for the offence\n\n    under Section 138 N I Act and convicted.  He is sentenced to undergo\n\n    imprisonment till rising of the court and to pay a fine of Rs.1,00,000/-\n\n    (Rupees one lakh only). On default of payment of fine, the accused\n\n    shall also undergo Simple Imprisonment for two months. The fine\n\n    amount on payment shall be disbursed to the complainant as\n\n    compensation under Section 357 (1)(b) Cr.P.C. The trial court shall\n\n    take measures to procure the presence of the accused and to get the\n\n    sentence executed without failure.\n\n\n                                                                         Sd/-\n                                                                  MARY JOSEPH\n                                                                        JUDGE\n    NAB"

This is an appeal impugning an order and judgment dated\n\n16.9.1998 passed by the Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, 40th\n\nCourt, Girgaon, Mumbai in a trial for commission of an offence\n\npunishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881.\n\nKJ                             2/9                                          209.Apeal904.98.doc\n\n2.            The complainant who is the appellant herein was an\n\nunpaid vendor.  The complainant claims to have supplied various\n\nquantities of paints during the period 1992 and indisputably the last\n\nsupply was on or about 30.6.1992.   Seven bills for a total sum of\n\nRs.1,38,897/- was raised on the accused.\n\n              On 15.5.1997 almost 5 years after the last supply was\n\nmade, the accused issued cheque bearing no.548403 for Rs.1,38,897/-\n\nwhich cheque was dishonoured on the same day, i.e., 15.5.1997 on\n\nthe ground  \u201caccount closed\u201d.  The complainant therefore sent notice\n\nto the accused vide Advocate\u2019s Notice dated 23.5.1997 which has been\n\nreceived by the accused and the accused has replied denying liability,\n\nwhich reply was received after the complaint was filed.  But since no\n\nreply was received within 15 days as contemplated under Section 138\n\nof the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, this complaint was filed.\n\n3.            The particulars of the offence was read over to the accused\n\nand explained to the accused who pleaded not guilty and claimed to\n\nbe tried.  During the trial, complainant has examined himself and\n\nproduced 10 documents.  During the cross-examination, two further\n\ndocuments have come on record, one of which is reply received by the\n\ncomplainant to the statutory notice after filing of the case.  Another\n\ndocument is summons issued under Section 91 of  Cr.P.C. to the\n\nKJ                             3/9                                          209.Apeal904.98.doc\n\nbankers which also consists of 5 letters signed by the Manager of the\n\nbank.\n\n4.            Apart from various arguments which I find have been\n\nraised in the written submissions by the Advocate for the accused and\n\nthe complainant, the main thrust of the accused was that the last\n\ntransaction was on 30.6.1992, cheque was issued on 15.5.1997 and\n\nhence the debt or the liability to the complainant is time barred. And\n\nas it is time barred, it is no more a legally enforceable debt or other\n\nliability as required under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments\n\nAct 1881 and hence the complaint was not tenable.  The trial Court in\n\nview of this legal point raised by the accused, decided to consider\n\nwhether the debt or the liability in question was legally enforceable\n\nand only if the answer to that issue was in the affirmative, felt the\n\nneed to consider whether the complainant has proved the ingredients\n\nof offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments\n\nAct 1881.  The trial Court relying on the judgment of a single Judge of\n\nthe Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of 1                   Girdhari Lal Rathi Vs.\n\nP.T.V.Ramanujachari & Anr.  concluded that in case a cheque is issued\n\nfor a time barred debt and it is dishonoured, the accused cannot be\n\nconvicted under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act simply\n\n1  1998 Bank Journal 127 Equivalent citations : 1997 (1) ALT Cri 509, 1998 (94)\n   CompCas 139 b AP\nKJ                             4/9                                          209.Apeal904.98.doc\n\non the ground that debt was not legally enforceable.  In view of this\n\nconclusion,  the trial Court did not consider whether the complainant\n\nhas proved the ingredients of offence punishable under Section 138 of\n\nthe Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 and dismissed the complaint.\n\nThis is the order that is impugned in this appeal.\n\n5.            The accused has not been appearing for quite some time.\n\nThe Court notings\u2019 indicate that warrant of arrest under Section 390 of\n\nCr.P.C. is duly executed and original accused has been released on\n\nbail.    There is an Advocate Mr.Tushar Joshi who had entered\n\nappearance for the accused and his name also appeared in the cause\n\nlist today.  He is not present either.\n\n6.            Mr.Nadar appearing for appellant submitted that the\n\nDivision Bench of our Court in 2            Dinesh B.Chokshi Vs. Rahul Vasudeo\n\nBhatt & Anr.  has taken a view contrary to the view taken by Andhra\n\nPradesh High Court. Mr.Nadar submitted that  Division Bench has held\n\nthat once a cheque is drawn for discharge of a time barred debt, it\n\ncreates a promise which becomes an enforceable contract and\n\ntherefore, it cannot be said that the cheque is drawn in discharge of\n\ndebt or liability which is not legally enforceable. Mr.Nadar submitted\n\n2  2012 ALL MR (Cri) 3656\nKJ                                           5/9                                                               209.Apeal904.98.doc\n\nthat therefore, the impugned judgment has to be set aside and the\n\nCourt should remand the matter back to the trial Court for hearing the\n\narguments on the issue whether the complainant has proved the\n\ningredients of offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable\n\nInstruments Act 1881.\n\n                     Ms.Malhotra, APP also concurred with the submissions\n\nmade by Mr.Nadar.\n\n7.                   I have considered the judgment in                                               Dinesh          B.     Chokshi\n\n (supra) . On the basis of a referral order passed by a learned single\n\nJudge, the Hon\u2019ble the Chief Justice passed an administrative order\n\ndirecting that all similar matters should be placed before the Division\n\nBench to decide the two questions viz.:-\n\n              (i) Does the issuance of a cheque in repayment of a time\n              barred debt amounts to a written promise to pay the said\n              debt within the meaning of Section 25(3) of the Indian\n              Contract Act, 1872 ?\n\n              (ii) If it amounts to such a promise, does such a promise,\n              by      itself,      create         any       legally        enforceable               debt       or     other\n              liability as contemplated by Section 138 of the Negotiable\n              Instruments Act, 1881 ?\n\n8.                   The Division Bench came to the conclusion that a cheque is\n\na promise within the meaning of sub section 3 of Section 25 of the\n\nContract Act and what follows is, when a cheque is drawn, a debt\n\nKJ                             6/9                                          209.Apeal904.98.doc\n\nwhich is not enforceable only by reason of bar of limitation, the\n\ncheque amounts to a promise governed by sub section 3 of Section 25\n\nof the Contract Act.  Such promise which is an agreement, becomes\n\nexception to the general rule that an agreement without consideration\n\nis void.  The Court held that though on the date of making such\n\npromise by issuing a cheque, the debt which is promised to be paid\n\nmay be already time barred, but in view of sub-section 3 of section 25\n\nof the Contract Act, the promise/agreement is valid and therefore, the\n\nsame is enforceable. The Court went on to hold while answering the\n\n2nd question that once it is held that the cheque drawn for discharge of\n\na time barred debt, creates a promise  which becomes enforceable\n\ncontract, it cannot be said that the cheque is drawn in discharge of\n\ndebt or liability which is not legally enforceable.   Paragraph-15 and\n\nparagraphs 19 to 21 of the said judgment read as under :-\n\n            \u201c15. On plain reading of            Section 13     of the said Act of\n            1881, a negotiable instrument does contain a promise to\n            pay the amount mentioned therein. The promise is given\n            by the drawer . Under Section 6 of the said Act of 1881,\n            a  cheque  is  a  bill  of  exchange  drawn  on  a  specified\n            banker. The drawer of a cheque promises to the person\n            in  whose  name  the  cheque  is  drawn  or  to  whom  the\n            cheque is endorsed, that the cheque on its presentation,\n            would yield the amount specified therein. Hence, it will\n            have to be held that a cheque is a promise within the\n            meaning of Sub-section (3) of Section 25 of the Contract\n            Act. What follows is that when a cheque is drawn to pay\n            wholly or in part, a debt which is not enforceable only\n            by reason of bar of limitation, the cheque amounts to a\n            promise governed by the Sub-section (3) of  Section 25\n\nKJ                             7/9                                          209.Apeal904.98.doc\n\n            of    the    Contract      Act.   Such      promise      which      is  an\n            agreement       becomes      exception     to  the  general     rule  that\n            an agreement without consideration is void. Though on\n            the date of making such promise by issuing a cheque,\n            the debt which is promised to be paid may be already\n            time barred, in view of Sub-section(3) of                  Sectin 25     of\n            the   Contract     Act,  the   promise/agreement          is  valid   and,\n            therefore, the same is enforceable. The promise to pay\n            time barred debt becomes a valid contract as held by the\n            Apex      Court     in   the    case    of   A.V.Moorthy         (supra).\n            Therefore, the first question will have to be answered in\n            the affirmative.\n\n            19. Under the Explanation to              Section 138,      the debt or\n            other liability referred to in the main Section has to be a\n            legally   enforceable      debt    or  liability.  Merely     because     a\n            cheque is drawn for discharge, in whole or in part of the\n            debt    or  other   liability,   Section    138    of  the  said   Act   of\n            1881     will  not    be  attracted.     The    provision     will  apply\n            provided the debt or other liability is legally enforceable.\n            Thus,    Section 138      will not apply to a cheque drawn in\n            discharge      of  a   debt   or   liability   which     is  not   legally\n            enforceable. There may be several categories of debts or\n            other liabilities which are not legally enforceable. A debt\n            or   liability   is legally    enforceable      if the   same     can   be\n            lawfully recovered by adopting due process of law. The\n            emphasis is on the fact that the debt or other liability\n            must be a legally enforceable liability. A debt or liability\n            ceases     to  be   legally    enforceable      after    expiry    of  the\n            period of limitation provided in the law of limitation for\n            filing   a  suit  for  recovery     of  the  amount.      Thus,    a  time\n            barred debt by no stretch of imagination can be said to\n            be a legally enforceable debt within the meaning of the\n            explanation to Section 138.\n\n            20. While recording our answer to the first Question, we\n            have already held that a cheque issued for discharge of\n            a  debt    which    is barred     by  law   of  limitation     is itself  a\n            promise      within     the   meaning       of   Sub-section      (3)    of\n            Section     25    of   the    Contract     Act.    A   promise      is  an\n            agreement        and    such    promise      which     is   covered     by\n            Section 25(3)       of the Contract Act becomes enforceable\n            contract    provided      that  the   same    is  not  otherwise      void\n\nKJ                             8/9                                          209.Apeal904.98.doc\n\n            under the Contract Act.\n\n            21. Therefore, while answering second Question, we are\n            specifically dealing with a case of promise created by a\n            cheque     issued  for  discharge  of  a  time  barred  debt  or\n            liability.  Once  it  is  held  that  a  cheque  drawn  for\n            discharge of a time barred debt creates a promise which\n            becomes enforceable contract, it cannot be said that the\n            cheque is drawn in discharge of debt or liability which is\n            not legally enforceable. The promise  in  the  form  of  a\n            cheque  drawn  in  discharge  of  a  time  barred  debt  or\n            liability becomes enforceable by virtue of Sub- section\n            (3) of Section 25 of the Contract Act. Thus, such cheque\n            becomes  a  cheque  drawn  in  discharge  of  a  legally\n            enforceable debt as contemplated by the explanation to\n            Section 138 of the said Act of 1881. Therefore, even the\n            second  question  will  have  to  be  answered  in  the\n            affirmative.\u201d\n\n9.            In the circumstances, once a cheque is drawn for discharge\n\nof a time barred debt, it creates a promise which becomes an\n\nenforceable contract and therefore, it cannot be said that the cheque is\n\ndrawn in discharge of debt or liability which is not legally enforceable.\n\nTherefore, I am satisfied that the impugned judgment dated 16.9.1998\n\nhas to be set aside and is hereby set aside.  The matter is remanded to\n\nthe trial Court to decide, based on the evidence already recorded,\n\nwhether the complainant has proved the ingredients of offence\n\npunishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881.\n\n10.           The dispute relates to the year 1997.  22 years have since\n\npassed. Therefore, registry to return the record & proceedings to the\n\nKJ                             9/9                                          209.Apeal904.98.doc\n\ntrial Court within two weeks.  The matter be placed before the trial\n\nCourt on 5.12.2019 for directions, on which date the complainant and\n\nthe accused shall without fail, remain present before the trial Court\n\neither in person or through their duly authorized Advocate.  The trial\n\nCourt shall hear the matter for arguments and deliver its judgment as\n\nearly as possible and in any event, on or before 15.2.2020.\n\n11.

Learned counsel for  petitioner submits that the Petitioner/Accused No.\n\n3 discovered during the defence evidence (vide Ex.DW2/H) about a complaint\n\nvide CT Cases 8423/2017 to initiate criminal proceeding for the offence of\n\ncheating filed under Section 200 Cr.P.C by Respondent No.1 /Complainant\n\nagainst Petitioner/Accused No.3 along with other accused persons and notice\n\nof which was not served upon Petitioner/Accused No. 3. Learned counsel\n\nfurther submits that Petitioner/Accused No. 3 was, hitherto, unaware of this\n\n CRL.M.C. 1772/2020                                                                      Page 6 of 14\ncomplaint case against him filed by Respondent No.1 / Complainant.\n\n11.         However,               the      complaint              vide       CT        Case        No.8423/2017                    to     initiate\n\ncriminal proceeding for the offence of cheating filed under Section 200 Cr.P.C\n\nfiled       by     Respondent                 No.1/Complainant                       against          Petitioner/Accused                       No.3\n\nalong with other accused persons was dismissed on absence of grounds for\n\ncheating            against          Petitioner/Accused                       No.       3    and        other        accused            persons.\n\nTherefore, the Petitioner/Accused No.3, upon discovery of new documents\n\nput up by Complainant to the Petitioner, DW -1 and his witnesses at the stage\n\nof defence evidence during cross-examination including the complaint vide\n\nCT Cases 8423/2017 to initiate criminal proceeding for the offence of\n\ncheating filed under Section 200 Cr.P.C by Respondent No.1 /Complainant\n\nagainst Petitioner/ Accused No.3 along with other accused persons. Learned\n\ncounsel for  petitioner further submits that learned Trial Court dismissed his\n\napplication filed under Section 311 Cr.P.C. ignoring the aforesaid fact and\n\nwithout application of mind.\n\n12.         This Court has perused the impugned order dated 29.08.2020 whereby\n\nrecorded that an application under Section 311 Cr.P.C. which was filed via\n\nemail on 20.08.2020 was not forwarded to the complainant side for necessary\n\naction.          Vide         the       said       application,               applicant             therein           sought           15      days\n\n CRL.M.C. 1772/2020                                                                      Page 7 of 14\nadjournment and from the averments in the application, it was seen that the\n\ncomplaint in CT cases 8423/2017 was filed in 2017 and it was dismissed in\n\n2017 itself. The complainant has admitted that the Ld. MM dismissed the\n\napplication uncontested at the initial stage for the reason that no prime facie\n\nallegations of cheating, etc. were there. Ld. MM was of the opinion that as per\n\nallegation only Section 138 N.I. Act complaint was made out and it was\n\nalready pending (subject matter of present complaint).\n\n13.         It is further recorded that prayer sought in the said application for\n\nadjournment for 15 days was not warranted for two reasons.  Firstly; the\n\ncomplaint was filed in 2017 and dismissed then, yet the accused side including\n\npetitioner waited till March 2020 to apply for certified copy of the complaint.\n\n14.         Moreover, during arguments, it was admitted by accused side that they\n\ncame to know about this complaint and dismissal in 2018 itself, yet the\n\nquestion arose before the Trial Court that as to why they waited till 2020,\n\nwhich          is    not       explained.             Moreover,               the       said       complaint              was        dismissed\n\nuncontested at initial stage and no opinion as to merits were expressed, thus,\n\nthere is no evidence in the complaint which needs to be put to the complainant\n\nfor any further cross examination. At the most, the CT cases 8423/2017 was\n\nan unsuccessful attempt by the complainant to initiate a parallel criminal\n\n CRL.M.C. 1772/2020                                                                      Page 8 of 14\nproceedings for cheating against the accused arising out of the same\n\ntransaction which is subject matter of the present case.  Cause of action for\n\nboth these complaints are different and since nothing was expressed on merits\n\nof Section 138 of N.I. Act complaint, any decision in CT Cases 8423/2017\n\ncan have no bearing on the merits of the present case. The application dated\n\n20.08.2020 moved via email for the purpose that certified copy of CT Cases\n\n8423/2017 is awaited therefore has no merits and is liable to be dismissed.\n\n15.          The main application of the petitioner moved under section 311\n\nCr.P.C., however, the Ld. M.M. after going through the same opined that the\n\napplication is vague and there are general averments. The only ground stated\n\nis that few documents were put to the defence witnesses which have to be put\n\nto the complainant for further cross examination. The petitioner has not\n\nspecified as to which documents need to be put and how the said is relevant\n\nin bringing home the defence of the accused. Ld. M.M. further opined that at\n\nthis juncture, if the defence of the accused taken at the time of framing notice\n\nunder section 251 Cr.P.C. is considered, wherein the accused side states that\n\nhe has substantiated his defence in his application under section 145(2) N.I.\n\nAct. The defence raised in the application were that (1) the accused was never\n\na director or employee or in any manner connected with Ms.Zexus Air\n\n CRL.M.C. 1772/2020                                                                      Page 9 of 14\nServices Pvt. Ltd.; and (2) the accused never approached the complainant to\n\nget any job done from the Ministry of Civil Aviation being not related to Ms.\n\nZexus Air Services Pvt. Ltd. and therefore there was no occasion for him to\n\ndraw the present cheque in question for any liability. It was further defended\n\nthat the cheque in question was given towards a proposed loan to be given by\n\nthe accused to the complainant, which was later refused by the accused and\n\nthe complainant misused the cheque in question.\n\n16.          Keeping in view the aforesaid fact, learned Trial Court opined that from\n\nthe records available, this has been a consistent stand/defence of the accused\n\nand he has cross-examined the complainant. The present application states\n\nthat further cross-examination is warranted for new documents which were\n\nput by complainant to defence witnesses. Although the accused side made no\n\nendeavour                to     substantiate                 as     to      which           documents                 it    wishes            to     put       to\n\ncomplainant. Accordingly, Ld. Trial Court further opined that the records\n\nshows that DWl/accused during his cross-examination was put 2 old cheque\n\nEx.CW1/1B                     and        Ex.CW1/1C                      which            were          admittedly                 drawn             by       the\n\naccused/DW1. DWl/X1 (Collectively) was admitted as printout of facebook\n\naccount of the accused/DW1. Ex.DWl/X1 was admitted to be the certified\n\ncopy ITR of the accused/DW1. Ex.DWl/X2 was admitted to be leave to\n\n CRL.M.C. 1772/2020                                                                      Page 10 of 14\ndefend filed by the accused/DW1. Ex.DW1/X3 offer letter and Ex.DWl/X4\n\naccount ledger were put the accused/DW1. Ex.DWl/X5, Ex.DWl/X6 and\n\nEx.DWl/X7 that are voice recording, certificate under section 65B Evidence\n\nAct and translated transcript, respectively, was placed on record and from\n\nthose recording voice from 17min:07 sec. to 17min:17sec. put to the accused\n\nwas admitted by the accused/DW1. Ex.DW1X8 was complaint copy received\n\nthrough RTI which is alleged to have been written by the accused/DW1.\n\n17.     In the impugned order, learned Trial Court observed as under:-\n\n             \u201c8.   Further     record     shows that       DW2     was    one    of  the\n             Director of Ms. Zexus Air Services Pvt. Ltd. from 2013 to\n             2017 and DW2/A was put to him which was identified as a\n             letter   dated    21.06.2015       written    by    then   CMD       (since\n             deceased) of Ms. Zexus Air Services Pvt. Ltd. to accused.\n             DW2 admitted the following documents put to him during\n             cross-examination- DW2/B-certificate of incorporation;\n             DW2/C-RTI         reply   containing      Form      32   and    Form     11\n             alongwith certificate under section 65B Evidence Act;\n             Ex.DW2/D-ITR for assessment year 2014-15 of Ms. Zexus\n             Air Services Pvt.

The other documents put to DW2 not admitted\n             were Ex.DW2/E-loan and three promissory note which\n             was part of record of a Civil case filed by the accused;\n             Ex.DW2/F-email purportedly sent by then CMD Ms. Zexus\n             Air Services Pvt.

Ltd. And\n            all the documents presented by DW3 from Ex.DW3/1 to\n            Ex.DW3/4 i.e. authority letter in favour of DW3,\n            confirmation of loan account, statement of bank account of\n            Ms. Zexus Air Services Pvt. Ltd., statement of account\n            showing repayment of loan of Rs.25 Lacs, respectively;\n            and all documents put to DW3 during cross examination\n            from Ex.DW3/X1 to Ex.DW3/X11 that are bank statement,\n            Form No. DIR 12, Form no. MGT7, ITRs, death certificate,\n            passport, NOC, experience certificate were all documents\n            pertaining to accounts or business operation of company\n            Ms. Zexus Air Services Pvt. Ltd. and its then CMD Sh.\n            Suriender Kumar Kaushik.\n\n            10.From the records above, it cannot be gathered as to\n            which document the accused side wants to put to the\n            complainant in his further cross-examination. Most of the\n            documents are either admitted by the defence witnesses or\n            pertains to Ms. Zexus Air Services Pvt. Ltd. Be that as it\n            may,      accused        side     despite      being      given      ample\n            opportunities, has failed to explain which document put to\n            any of the defence witness would probably substantiate his\n            defence taken at the time of framing of notice under Section\n            251    CrPC.      The     application      therefore,     for   recall    of\n            complainant for further cross-examination is completely\n            baseless. From the above discussion, this Court sees no\n            such document which needs to be put to the complainant\n            for further cross-examination, which would substantiate\n            the defence of the accused in the present case. It is a settled\n            principle     of  law    that   Section     311    Cr.P.C.     cannot     be\n            allowed to fill in any lacunae in the trial or to delay the\n            trial, as was also held in Umar Mohammad & Ors. v. State\n            of Rajasthan, (2007) 14 SCC 711. The application dated\n            20.08.2020 filed on the email seeking 15 days adjournment\n            as well as application under section 311 Cr.P.C. are\n            hereby dismissed. Nothing expressed in this Order shall\n            have a bearing on the merits of the present case.\u201d\n\n CRL.M.C. 1772/2020                                                                      Page 12 of 14\n\n18. In addition to above, learned Trial Court has considered the fact that the\n\n complainant is a Senior Citizen and the matter is pending for more than five\n\n years. This Court directed the Trial Court to expedite the trial. Accordingly,\n\n Trial Court deemed it appropriate to grant only one opportunity to both the\n\n sides to complete their oral arguments. Parties are at liberty to file written\n\n submission by 10.09.2020. Ld. Trial Court further clarified that no further\n\n adjournment shall be granted.\n\n19. In view of above facts, filing of application at belated stage which does\n\n not prejudice to the rights and contention of the petitioner, I am of the view\n\n such application is delay tactics to get the trial delayed.\n\n20. Learned counsel for petitioner  has relied upon the judgment in the case\n\n of P. Sanjeeva Rao v. State of A.P.: (2012) 7 SCC 56; Venu Madhava K. vs.\n\n State (NCT of Delhi): 2017 SCC OnLine Del 12064 and Mannan Shaikh v.\n\n State of W.B.: (2014) 13 SCC 59, however, the judgments relied upon by\n\n learned counsel for  petitioner are of no help in the present case.\n\n21. Accordingly, I find no illegality and perversity in the impugned order\n\n dated 29.08.2020 passed by the Trial Court.\n\n  CRL.M.C. 1772/2020                                                                      Page 13 of 14\n22. In view of above, the petition is dismissed.\n\n23. Pending application also stands disposed of.\n\n24.

The learned counsel for the revision petitioner made the\nfollowing further submissions before me:-\n        The specific case of the revision petitioner was that the\ntransaction set up by the complainant was false and that Ext.P1 was a\nsigned blank cheque which he had entrusted with one George while an\nemployee of the revision petitioner availed a loan from the said George.\nThe cheque was offered as a security for the loan availed by the\nemployee and the same was misutilised by the said George by handing\nit over to the complainant's brother who in turn was passing it on to the\ncomplainant.\n        5.      This version of the revision petitioner was not believed by\nthe courts below.  If the cheque was entrusted with one George as\nalleged, George would have been the best person to be cited as a\nwitness.  At least the petitioner could have cited the employee for whom\nhe claims to have stood as a surety.  That was also not done.  Instead,\nthe person who was examined as DW1 is one who claims to have\nwitnessed the aforesaid transaction.  If such a transaction as alleged by\nthe accused had taken place, then as a reasonable and prudent man,\nthe revision petitioner would have proceeded against the said George\nfor betraying the confidence reposed in him.  But, for reasons best\nknown to the revision petitioner, no steps appear to have been taken\nagainst the said George.  Equally misconceived is the request of theCrl.R.P.No.3764/07\n                                              : 3 :\n\nrevision petitioner to send the cheque to the handwriting expert for\nascertaining the age of the writings on the cheque.  When the\ntransaction set up by the revision petitioner itself was not proved, there\nwas no need for sending the cheque to the handwriting expert.  It is\npertinent to note that the revision petitioner did not send any reply also\nto the statutory notice.  Both the courts have considered and rejected\nthe defence set up by the revision petitioner while  entering the above\nfinding.   The said finding has been recorded on an appreciation of the\noral and documentary evidence.  I do  not find any error, illegality or\nimpropriety in the finding so recorded concurrently by the courts below.\nThe conviction was thus rightly entered against  the  petitioner.\n        6.      What now survives for consideration is the question as to\nwhether a proper sentence has been imposed on the Revision\nPetitioner.  I am, however, inclined to modify the sentence imposed on\nthe revision petitioner provided he complies with the condition\nhereinafter mentioned.  Accordingly, if the revision petitioner pays to the\n2nd respondent complainant by way of compensation under section 357\n(3) Cr.P.C. a sum of Rs.60,000/- (Rupees sixty thousand only) within\nfive months from today, then he need to undergo only imprisonment till\nthe rising of the court.  If on the other hand, the revision petitioner\ncommits default in making the payment as aforesaid, he shall undergo\nsimple imprisonment for three months by way of default sentence.Crl.R.P.No.3764/07\n                                              : 4 :\n\nMoney, if any, paid by the revision petitioner pursuant to the orders, if\nany, passed by the lower appellate court shall be refunded to the\nrevision petitioner.\n        This Revision is disposed of confirming the conviction but\nmodifying the sentence as above.\n\n                                                             (V.

The above said Calendar Case was taken on file by the learned XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate based on the compalint of the appellant herein preferred under Section 200 Cr.P.C. alleging that the respondent herein had committed an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1983.\n\n\t3. According to the appellant/complainant, the respondent obtained a loan of Rs.3 lakhs promising to repay the same with interest @ 36% per annum and in discharge of the said debt and a cheque dated 11.9.1998 was issued by the respondent for the above said amount.  When the said cheque was presented for encashment on 14.9.1998 through the appellant's banker, the same was returned on 15.9.1998 with an endorsement \"insufficient funds\".  The statutory notice issued thereafter on 22.9.1998 was received by the respondent on 23.9.1998. Even after the receipt of the said notice, the respondent did not make payment of the amount covered by the cheque within the statutory period, but chose to issue a reply notice.  Hence, the complaint was preferred for prosecuting him for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.  \n\n\t4. The respondent, who appeared before the trial court on receipt of process, pleaded not guilty and denied the allegations found in the complaint.  During trial, three witnesses were examined and 10 documents were marked on the side of the appellant/complainant.  When the incriminating part of the evidence adduced on the side of the complainant was pointed out and the respondent/accused was examined under Section 313 Cr.P.C., besides denying such incriminating evidence, the respondent has taken a specific stand that the cheque was not issued for the discharge of a legally recoverable debt.  The learned Magistrate, after meticulously examining the evidence adduced in this case, came to the conclusion that the appellant/complainant failed to prove that the cheque was issued for the discharge of a legally recoverable debt or other liability and in line with the said finding, the learned Magistrate acquitted the respondent/accused by her judgment dated 8.4.2002.  Challenging the correctness and the legality of the said judgment of acquittal, the present appeal has been preferred on the file of this Court.\n\n\t5. The arguments advance on behalf of the appellant and the respondent have been heard.  The materials available on record were also perused by this Court.\n\n\t6. The unsuccessful complainant before the trial court is the appellant in this appeal, which has been filed against the acquittal of the accused in C.C. No.411 of 1999 on the file of the learned XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai.  The respondent herein stood charged for committing an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Upon perusing the records and re-appraising the evidence in the light of the arguments advanced by the learned counsel appearing on either side, this Court is not able to find out any discrepancy or infirmity in the approach of the learned Magistrate and the decision made by the said Magistrate holding the respondent/accused not guilty of the offence with which he stood charged. Though the appellant/complainant had stated in its complaint that the cheque was issued in discharge of the debt due to the appellant/complainant to the tune of Rs.3 lakhs, there are no details regarding the date on which the amount was borrowed and the documents executed for the same.  Though the details of the cheque has been furnished in the complaint, the language of the complaint has been couched in such a way that one going through the complaint would be guessing as to what could be the date on which the cheque was actually issued.  Such an ingenious method of drafting the complaint has been adopted.  Learned counsel for the respondent, pointing out the said fact, has contended that in fact, the blank cheque without date was handed over as an additional security for the loan advanced by the appellant/complainant and that the same was subsequently filled up by putting a date in 1998 and used by the appellant in this case.\n\n\t7. In support of the said contention, the learned counsel has taken this Court through the evidence of PW1, who during cross-examination, has candidly admitted that the loan was advanced in 1993, a pronote as well as the blank cheque was obtained in 1993 and the cheque was presented for collection in 1998, on the instructions of the respondent/accused.  The implication of the said admission is twofold.  They are : (i) the admission that the cheque was issued as a security for the loan and not for the discharge of the loan is to be used in support of the case of the respondent/accused that the cheque was not issued for the discharge of a debt or other liability as provided under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.  The said admission itself will be enough to rebut the presumption provided under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. (ii) The second implication of the said admission is that the debt which was incurred by the respondent/accused in the year 1993 was time barred even before the date of the cheque.  Hence, the cheque could not be construed as one issued in discharge of a legally recoverable debt or other liability.  It is not the case of the appellant/complainant that the debt incurred in the year 1993 was subsequently acknowledged giving a new start of limitation. It is also not the case of the appellant/complainant that a fresh promise was made for the payment of the time barred debt and the time barred debt itself proved to be the consideration for such a fresh promise.\n\n\t8. The learned Magistrate has marshalled the evidence in this regard properly and has come to the correct conclusion that the appellant/complainant failed to prove the charge against the respondent/accused beyond reasonable doubt and that the respondent accused was entitled to be acquitted, holding him not guilty of the offence for which he stood charged.   There  is  no merit in this appeal as no scope whatsoever is found to interfere with the well considered judgment of the trial court.  The judgment of the trial court deserves to be confirmed.  \n\n\t9. Accordingly, the criminal appeal is dismissed.  The remuneration of the learned counsel for the respondent shall be paid in accordance with the schedule of fee applicable to the Legal Aid Counsel.\n\n\n\ngs.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nTo\n\nThe XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, \nChennai.\n"

This  is an application for grant of  leave  to\n\n              appeal.   The  accused  have been acquitted  for  an\n\n              offence  punishable under Section 138 of  Negotiable\n\n              Instruments Act.  A cheque in question was issued in\n\n              the  year 2003 for an amount of Rs.8,00,000/-.   The\n\n              accused had taken a loan of Rs.10,00,000/- which was\n\n              given  to them by two separate amounts of Rs.8 lakhs\n\n              and  Rs.2  lakhs.   Thereafter  there  is  a  yearly\n\n              confirmation  of the balance amount which is due  to\n\n              the  Complainant.  The said documents are signed  by\n\n              both  parties.   A  glance at the last  document  of\n\n              confirmation  which  is   dated  1.1.2002  indicates\n\n              balance  amount of Rs.4,70,000/-.  A glance on these\n\n              documents  also indicate that there is no  reference                                :  2  :\n\n              of  the interest paid.  The case of the accused  was\n\n              that interest has been paid separately by cash.  The\n\n              Complainant  in his cross-examination admitted  that\n\n              he  was taking interest in cash but according to him\n\n              that   interest  was  in   respect  of  some   other\n\n              transaction.   The other transaction referred to  in\n\n              the  cross-examination has however, not been brought\n\n              on   record.   In   the  cross-examination,  witness\n\n              admitted  that these transactions pertained to  cash\n\n              loan   which   was  given  to  the   accused.    The\n\n              Complainant\u2019s  witness is a Chartered Accountant and\n\n              once  it  is admitted by him that interest has  been\n\n              taken by way of cash then the absence of any entries\n\n              in  the interest paid column stand explained and  at\n\n              the  very  least,  defence   become  probable.   The\n\n              correct  procedure  which is to be followed  by  the\n\n              Complainant  was  to show outstanding  interest  and\n\n              balance  amount  inclusive of interest.  Instead  of\n\n              this  procedure adopted, he is issuing  confirmation\n\n              letters for income tax purposes.  If a larger amount\n\n              inclusive  of interest was due from the accused then\n\n              this  ought  to have been shown in the  confirmation\n\n              letter  as  no  tax could have been  levied  on  the\n\n              amount which has not been received.  It was also the\n\n              defence of the accused that a blank cheque was given\n\n              when  the  loan was taken.  The fact that amount  of\n\n              cheque  is  Rs.8  lakhs which  co-incides  with  the\n\n              amount  of  Rs.8  lakhs  as a part of  the  loan  is\n\n              significant.  Even if the alternate argument made on                                :  3  :\n\n              behalf  of  the complainant, to the effect that  the\n\n              cheque  of  Rs.8  lakhs  was given  as  a  one  time\n\n              settlement  and  that  it was a settlement  for  the\n\n              amount  of  principal  due  alongwith  interest,  is\n\n              accepted, yet there would be no acknowledgment in so\n\n              far  as interest amount is concerned within a period\n\n              of  limitation.  That part of the interest which  is\n\n              beyond the period of limitation cannot be said to be\n\n              legally  enforcible  debt.   In  this  view  of  the\n\n              matter,  I  find  that  this is not a  fit  case  to\n\n              interfere  with  in  an  appeal  against  acquittal.\n\n              Hence leave refused.  Consequently, appeal papers to\n\n              be filed.\n\n                                                   (R.S.Mohite,J)"

MADAAN, J.\n\n                In a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable\n\nInstruments Act, 1881 titled 'Ashok Kumar Dawar Versus Raman\n\nSharma', during the course of trial, the accused Raman Sharma had filed\n\nan application for summoning the concerned Clerk along with record of\n\ncomplaint titled as 'Deepak Dawar Versus Sonia Sharma' to prove on\n\nrecord complaint, affidavit, documents and cross examination recorded on\n\nthe said complaint. He also wanted to summon the record of IDBI Bank,\n\nFeroze Gandhi Market, Ludhiana with regard to cheque in question,\n\nbesides examining concerned Clerk of SBI, Chaura Bazaar, Ludhiana\n\nalong with record of account opening form and specimen signature card of\n\nSonia Sharma.\n\n                It may be mentioned here that complainant Ashok KumarCRR-495-2020                                                                    -2-\n\nDawar had filed a separate complaint against Sonia Sharma wife of\n\naccused Raman Sharma.\n\n                       That application was opposed vehemently on behalf of the\n\ncomplainant. Learned Magistrate dismissed the application with the\n\nfollowing observations:\n\n                       \u201cThe accused wants to examine defence witnesses. It is a\n\n                       matter of record that another complaint Deepak Dawar Vs.\n\n                       Sonia Sharma is pending and proceedings in that case are\n\n                       stayed by the Hon'ble High Court. It is pertinent to mention\n\n                       here that the witnesses sought to be examined by the defence\n\n                       has no relevancy in this case. Parties in both the cases are\n\n                       different. Therefore, in light of the facts and circumstances of\n\n                       the present case and averments made in the application, this\n\n                       Court finds the present application without merits and liable\n\n                       to be dismissed. Allowing such kinds of applications will\n\n                       flood open the gates for similar kind of applications in each\n\n                       and every case, which will ultimately become abuse of\n\n                       process of law. It is correct that under Section 311 Cr.P.C.\n\n                       put obligation upon the Court to summon and examine and\n\n                       recall and re-examine any witness where the evidence of\n\n                       such witness is essential for the just decision of the case.\n\n                       However, in the present case, this Court is of confirm and\n\n                       considered                 view           that         the         facts          on         which            the\n\n                       applicant/accused seeks summoning and examination of\n\n                       witnesses has no relevancy in this case. Therefore, this CourtCRR-495-2020                                           -3-\n\n                does not find the summoning and examination of the\n\n                witnesses essential for the just decision of the case.\n\n                Feeling aggrieved, the accused has approached this Court by\n\nway of filing of revision petition seeking setting aside of the order in\n\nquestion and acceptance of application under Section 311 Cr.P.C.\n\n                I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner besides going\n\nthrough the record and I find that there is absolutely no merit in the\n\npetition.\n\n                No doubt the accused has a right to lead evidence in defence\n\nduring trial against him but that evidence must be relevant.

That the complainant had a MEMORANDUM\n                OF UNDERSTANDING (hereinafter to be referred as\n                MOU) with the accused persons which was executed on\n                11th of January 2016, at Delhi. In pursuance of the terms of\n                the MOU the details of which has been mentioned in the\n                subsequent paragraphs, certain cheques were issued by\n                the accused no.1, through the authorized signatories, who\n                are accused Nos.2 & 3. Since the cheques issued by the\n                accused persons, the details of which has been mentioned\n                in the subsequent paragraphs, have been dis-honoured on\n                account of insufficient funds, the complainant has filed the\n                present complaint against the accused persons in view of\n                the provisions of section 142 R/w Section 138 of the\n                Negotiable        Instruments       Act     1881.      Copy       of    the\n                Memorandum of Understanding dated 11.01.2016 is\n                annexed herewith and marked as Annexure C/1.\n                        2.      I say that the MOU was executed at Delhi and\n                present registered office of the accused no.1 being at M/s\n                Concept Horizon Infra Pvt. Ltd. 8/13, 1st Floor, Hospital\n                Road, Jangpura Extension, New Delhi-110014. Since the\n                complainant has the regular bank account in HDFC Bank,\n                Corporate Sewa Park, MG Road, Gurugram, Haryana,\n                122001 where he deposited the cheque dated 11th                           of\n                January, 2018 bearing cheque number 019086, which was\n                dishonoured, therefore, this Hon'ble Court has the\n                jurisdiction to take cognizance in the present case against\n                the accused persons for the offence punishable under\n                Section 138 read with 142 of the Negotiable Instruments\n                Act 1881, and also under section 420 IPC.\n                        3.      That the accused no.2, 3 and 4 have been\n                made parties since the accused persons no.2 and 3 haveCRM-M No. 40532, 40503, 42148, 42149, 42151 and 42155 of 2019 (O&M)\n                                                                                               4\n                been Directors as well as signatories to the cheques which\n                got dishonoured and \u201cthe accused no.4 being in-charge\n                of the affairs of accused no.1.\u201d\n                Counsel for the petitioner has further submitted that the\nvery basis of filing the complaints is a Memorandum of Understanding\n(MOU) between the complainant and accused Nos.2 and 3 and the\npetitioner is not a signatory of the Memorandum of Understanding on\nthe basis of which some business transactions started between them. It\nis further argued that the petitioner is neither an authorized signatory on\nthe cheques nor, he is the Director of accused No.1 \u2013 Company. It is\nalso submitted that the petitioner has been arrayed as accused in the\npresent complaints only because he is brother-in-law of accused No.2\nand at no point of time, he has any business dealing with complainant.\nIt is further submitted that the only allegations in all the complaints is\nin para 3 wherein it is stated that accused Nos.2 and 3 are the Directors\nand accused No.4 is In-charge of the affairs of accused No.1 \u2013\nCompany.\n                Counsel for the petitioner in support of his arguments has\nreferred to the Memorandum of Understanding dated 11.01.2016, which\nis entered between the accused No.1 \u2013 Company through its Director\nSuninder Sandha as first party and the complainant \u2013 Jagmeet S. Soin\nas the second party.\n                Counsel for the petitioner has further referred to Clause (4)\nof this Memorandum of Understanding wherein the disputed cheques\nnumbers are given. It is further submitted that all these cheques are\ndrawn on Punjab and Sind Bank and accused Nos.2 and 3 are theCRM-M No. 40532, 40503, 42148, 42149, 42151 and 42155 of 2019 (O&M)\n                                                                                               5\nsignatories of the cheques and the petitioner/accused No.4 is not a\nsignatory.\n                Counsel for the petitioner has also referred to one of the\ncheque bearing No.01908 for Rs.10,000,000/-, which is signed by\naccused Nos.2 and 3 only. It is further argued that even, in the legal\nnotice issued by the complainant on 25.01.2018, there are no direct\nallegations against the petitioner that he was In-charge of the day-to-\nday business of the Company or is one of the signatory of the cheques.\n                Counsel for the petitioner has lastly, relied upon the list of\nDirector of accused No.1 \u2013 Company, to submit that the petitioner is not\na Director of accused No.1 \u2013 Company.\n                Counsel for the petitioner has also relied upon the\njudgment       \u201cNational Small          Industries Corporation Limited vs\nHarmeet Singh Paintal and another\u201d, 2010(3) SCC 330,  wherein the\nHon\u2019ble Supreme Court has held as under:-\n                        \u201c12.    It is very clear from the above provision that\n                what is required is that the persons who are sought to be\n                made vicariously liable for a criminal offence under\n                Section 141        should be, at the time the offence was\n                committed, was in-charge of, and was responsible to the\n                company for the conduct of the business of the company.\n                Every person connected with the company shall not fall\n                within the ambit of the provision. Only those persons who\n                were in-charge of and responsible for the conduct of the\n                business of the company at the time of commission of an\n                offence will be liable for criminal action. It follows from\n                the fact that if a Director of a Company who was not in-\n                charge of and was not responsible for the conduct of the\n                business of the company at the relevant time, will not beCRM-M No. 40532, 40503, 42148, 42149, 42151 and 42155 of 2019 (O&M)\n                                                                                               6\n                liable for a criminal offence under the provisions. The\n                liability arises from being in-charge of and responsible for\n                the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant\n                time when the offence was committed and not on the basis\n                of merely holding a designation or office in a company.\n                        13. Section 141  is a penal provision creating\n                vicarious liability, and which, as per settled law, must be\n                strictly construed. It is therefore, not sufficient to make a\n                bald cursory statement in a complaint that the Director\n                (arrayed as an accused) is in charge of and responsible to\n                the company for the conduct of the business of the\n                company without anything more as to the role of the\n                Director. But the complaint should spell out as to how and\n                in what manner Respondent No.1 was in-charge of or was\n                responsible to the accused company for the conduct of its\n                business. This is in consonance with strict interpretation of\n                penal statutes, especially, where such statutes create\n                vicarious liability.\n                        14.     A company may have a number of Directors\n                and to make any or all the Directors as accused in a\n                complaint merely on the basis of a statement that they are\n                in-charge of and responsible for the conduct of the\n                business of the company without anything more is not a\n                sufficient or adequate fulfillment of the requirements under\n                Section 141.\n                        15.     In a catena of decisions, this Court has held\n                that for making Directors liable for the offences committed\n                by the company under Section 141 of the Act, there must be\n                specific averments against the Directors, showing as to\n                how and in what manner the Directors were responsible\n                for the conduct of the business of the company.\n                        16.     In the light of the above provision and the\n                language used therein, let us, at the foremost, examine the\n                complainta filed by National Small Industries CorporationCRM-M No. 40532, 40503, 42148, 42149, 42151 and 42155 of 2019 (O&M)\n                                                                                               7\n                Limited and the DCM Financial Services Ltd.\n                        17.     In the case of National Small Industries\n                Corpn. Ltd., the High Court has reproduced the entire\n                complaint in the impugned order and among other clauses,\n                clause 8 is relevant for our consideration which reads as\n                under:\n                        \"8. That the accused No. 2 is the Managing Director\n                and accused No. 3 is the Director of the accused company.\n                The accused No. 2 and 3 are the in-charge and responsible\n                for the conduct of the business of the company accused\n                No.1 and hence are liable for the offences.\"\n                        18.     In the case of DCM Financial Services Ltd.,\n                in complaint- Annexure-P2 the relevant clause is 13 which\n                reads as under:\n                        \"13. That the accused No. 1 is a Company/Firm and\n                the accused Nos. 2 to 9 were in charge and were\n                responsible to the accused No. 1 for the conduct of the\n                business to the accused No. 1 at the time when offence was\n                committed. Hence, the accused Nos. 2 to 9 in addition to\n                the accused No. 1, are liable to be prosecuted and\n                punished in accordance with law by this Hon'ble Court as\n                provided by Section 141 of the N.I. Act, 1881. Further the\n                offence has been committed by the accused No. 1 with the\n                consent and connivance of the accused Nos. 2 to 9.\"\n                Hon'ble Supreme Court in Para 37 to 39 of this judgment\nhas laid down the following principles :-\n                        37.     A combined reading of Sections 5 and 291 of\n                Companies Act, 1956 with the definitions in clauses (24),\n                (26), (30), (31) and (45) of Section 2 of that Act would\n                show that the following persons are considered to be the\n                persons who are responsible to the company for the\n                conduct of the business of the company:\n                (a) the Managing Director(s);CRM-M No. 40532, 40503, 42148, 42149, 42151 and 42155 of 2019 (O&M)\n                                                                                               8\n                (b) the whole-time Director(s);\n                (c) the Manager;\n                (d) the Secretary;\n                (e) any person in accordance with whose directions or\n                instructions the Board of Directors of the company is\n                accustomed to act;\n                (f) any person charged by the Board of Directors with the\n                responsibility of complying with that provision;\n                        Provided that the person so charged has given his\n                consent in this behalf to the Board;\n                (g) where any company does not have any of the officers\n                specified in clauses (a) to (c), any director or directors\n                who may be specified by the Board in this behalf or where\n                no director is so specified, all the directors:\n                        Provided that where the Board exercises any power\n                under clause (f) or clause (g), it shall, within thirty days of\n                the exercise of such powers, file with the Registrar a\n                return in the prescribed form.\n                38.     But if the accused is not one of the persons who falls\n                under the category of \"persons who are responsible to the\n                company for the conduct of the business of the company\"\n                then merely by stating that \"he was in-charge of the\n                business of the company\" or by stating that \"he was in-\n                charge of the day-to-day management of the company\" or\n                by stating that \"he was in-charge of, and was responsible\n                to the company for the conduct of the business of the\n                company\",        he    cannot      be    made      vicariously       liable\n                under Section 141(1) of the Act. To put it clear that for\n                making      a  person  liable  under Section  141(2),  the\n                mechanical repetition of the requirements under Section\n                141(1) will be of no assistance, but there should be\n                necessary averments in the complaint as to how and in\n                what manner the accused was guilty of consent andCRM-M No. 40532, 40503, 42148, 42149, 42151 and 42155 of 2019 (O&M)\n                                                                                               9\n                connivance or negligence and therefore, responsible under\n                sub-section (2) of Section 141 of the Act.\n                        39.     From the above discussion, the following\n                principles emerge :\n                        (i) The primary responsibility is on the complainant\n                to make specific averments as are required under the law\n                in the complaint so as to make the accused vicariously\n                liable. For fastening the criminal liability, there is no\n                presumption        that    every     Director      knows      about     the\n                transaction.\n                        (ii) Section 141 does not make all the Directors\n                liable for the offence. The criminal liability can be\n                fastened only on those who, at the time of the commission\n                of the offence, were in charge of and were responsible for\n                the conduct of the business of the company.\n                        (iii) Vicarious liability can be inferred against a\n                company registered or incorporated under the Companies\n                Act, 1956 only if the requisite statements, which are\n                required to be averred in the complaint/petition, are made\n                so as to make accused therein vicariously liable for\n                offence committed by company along with averments in\n                the petition containing that accused were in-charge of and\n                responsible for the business of the company and by virtue\n                of their position they are liable to be proceeded with.\n                        (iv) Vicarious liability on the part of a person must\n                be pleaded and proved and not inferred.\n                        (v) If accused is Managing Director or Joint\n                Managing Director then it is not necessary to make\n                specific averment in the complaint and by virtue of their\n                position they are liable to be proceeded with.\n                        (vi) If accused is a Director or an Officer of a\n                company who signed the cheques on behalf of the\n                company then also it is not necessary to make specific\n                averment in complaint.CRM-M No. 40532, 40503, 42148, 42149, 42151 and 42155 of 2019 (O&M)\n                                                                                             10\n                        (vii) The person sought to be made liable should be\n                in- charge of and responsible for the conduct of the\n                business of the company at the relevant time. This has to\n                be averred as a fact as there is no deemed liability of a\n                Director in such cases.\u201d\n                Counsel for the petitioner has, thus, argued that in view of\nthe principles laid down in the aforesaid judgment it is the primary\nresponsibility of the complainant to make specific averment against the\naccused, who are vicariously liable whereas in the present case, no such\nallegations are there in the complaint. It is also submitted that in view\nof the judgment National Small Industries Corporation Limited\u2019s\nsupra, as per Section 141 of the NI Act, all the Directors cannot be held\nliable for the offence and the criminal liability can be fastened only on\nthose Directors, who at the time of commission of offence, were the In-\ncharge of and were responsible, for the business and conduct of the\nCompany. Lastly, it is argued by counsel for the petitioner that a person\nsought to be made liable, should be In-charge and responsible for the\nconduct of the business of the Company at the relevant time and the\nimpugned complaints do not meet any of the ingredients of the\nprinciples laid down by the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court.\n                Counsel for the respondent, on the basis of the reply filed\nby the respondent/complainant has submitted that the petitioner is also\nIn-charge of the Company, however, counsel for the respondent has\nfairly conceded that there is no document to support the contention of\nthe complainant that either the petitioner is a signatory of Memorandum\nof Understanding or is a signatory of the cheques and therefore, theCRM-M No. 40532, 40503, 42148, 42149, 42151 and 42155 of 2019 (O&M)\n                                                                                             11\narguments of the petitioner on these points could not be disputed by\ncounsel for the respondent.\n                Counsel for the respondent has further argued that the\nallegations against the other two accused i.e. accused Nos.2 and 3 are\nthat they are Directors, In-charge of business and signatories of the\ncheques.\n                After hearing the counsel for the parties and going through\nall the complaints as well as the reply filed by the complainant, I find\nmerit in the present petition for the following reasons:-\n                        (a)     The complaint is based on a Memorandum\n                of Understanding, which is not signed by the petitioner\n                and is rather signed by accused No.3 \u2013 Suninder Sandha.\n                The dishonoured cheques were given to the complainant\n                at   the    time     of  signing       of   the  Memorandum  of\n                Understanding.\n                        (b)     The cheque numbers of the disputed cheques\n                are duly mentioned in the body of the Memorandum of\n                Understanding signed by accused No.3 \u2013 Suninder\n                Sandha, which show that he was the person In-charge of\n                the Company as he entered into a Memorandum of\n                Understanding on behalf of accused No.1 \u2013 Company\n                and had issued the cheques in favour of the complainant.\n                        (c)     Even the cheques are not signed by the\n                petitioner and the same are signed  by  accused  Nos.2\n                and 3.\n                        (d)     In the complaints, the only allegation inCRM-M No. 40532, 40503, 42148, 42149, 42151 and 42155 of 2019 (O&M)\n                                                                                             12\n                para 3 is that accused No.4 \u2013 petitioner is In-charge of\n                the affairs of accused No.1 \u2013 Company, however, there is\n                no document to support this version and rather in the\n                reply filed by the complainant in this Court, nowhere\n                reflects that the petitioner is the In-charge of the affairs\n                of accused No.1 \u2013 Company, in any manner.\n                        (e)     There is nothing on record to support the\n                complaints that the petitioner is one Director of accused\n                No.1 \u2013 Company as it is the case of the petitioner that he\n                never remained the Director of accused No.1 \u2013 Company\n                at any stage and this fact is not disputed in the reply.\n                For the foregoing reasons and in view of the judgment\nNational Small Industries Corporation Limited\u2019s case (supra) passed\nby the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court, the present petitions are allowed; the\nsummoning order dated 07.04.2018 is set-aside and the impugned\ncomplaints No. 4661 of 2018, 4663, 4665, 4662, 4666 and 4664 of\n2018 dated 06.03.2018 filed under Section 138 of the NI Act and all\nother subsequent proceedings arising therefrom, are ordered to be\nquashed qua the petitioner only.\n\n                                                 (ARVIND SINGH SANGWAN)\n05.03.2020                                                           JUDGE\nyakub\n\n                Whether speaking/reasoned                        Yes/No\n                Whether reportable:                              Yes/No"

This  is  an  application   for  leave  to\n\n Appeal.\n\n 2.          By  the  impugned judgment and order,  the\n\n accused  have been acquitted under Section 138  of\n\n the Negotiable Instruments Act.\n\n 3.          On  perusal  of the impugned judgment  and\n\n order,  I  find  that the acquittal  is  based  on\n\n cogent  reasons.  The loan was given on two  dates\n\n and  the  last instalment was given  on  5/2/1997.\n\n The  cheque  was  issued on  22/9/2000,  which  is\n\n beyond the period of three years.  The trial Court\n\n held  that debt is not legally enforceable debt as                                                  2\n\n the  recovery  of  debt was time barred.   It  was\n\n contended  that the issuance of cheque even  after\n\n the period of limitation would be a fresh cause of\n\n action  within the meaning of Section 25(3) of the\n\n Negotiable Instruments Act.\n\n 4.                   Reliance  was placed by the Division Bench\n\n judgment  of Kerala High Court in the case of  Dr.\n\n K.K.Ram  vs.   K.K.  Parthasarthi.  This  judgment\n\n has  been  dealt  with by a Single Judge  of  this\n\n Court  in the case of Narendra V.Kanetkar Vs.  The\n\n Barzed   Taluka  Co-operative   Housing   Mortgage\n\n Society  Ltd.   and  Another   reported  in   2007\n\n (Criminal)  275.   The Single Judge of this  Court\n\n has  held that in view of Division Bench  judgment\n\n of  this  Court and several other judgments  which\n\n held  that  in case of time barred debt  or  other\n\n liability, Section 138 of the Act is not attracted\n\n and  the accused cannot be convicted under Section\n\n 138  of  the Act.  Our Court has not followed  the\n\n Division  Bench judgment.  There is observation in\n\n Para  no.9 which suggest that a suit can be  filed\n\n in  pursuance  to  a promise made in  writing  and\n\n signed  by the person to be charged therewith,  as\n\n contemplated  by Clause 3 of Section 25 of Law  of\n\n Contract,   then   the    debt   becomes   legally                                                  3\n\n enforceable and if a cheque is given in payment of\n\n such debt and is dishonoured and subsequently, the\n\n statutory  notice  is not complied with  then  the\n\n person  making the promise in writing and  issuing\n\n the  cheque, would be liable to be punished  under\n\n Section 138 of the Act.\n\n .

NARAYANA PISHARADI, J\n             ----------------------------------------------------\n                                 Crl.R.P.No.226 of 2020\n            -----------------------------------------------------\n                            Dated this the 2nd day of March, 2020\n                                              O R D E R\n\n         The revision petitioner is the accused in the case S.T No.\n\n2690/2015 on the file of the Court of the Judicial First Class\n\nMagistrate-I, Kannur.\n\n        2.      The trial court found the petitioner guilty of the offence\n\npunishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\n(hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') and convicted him thereunder and\n\nsentenced him to imprisonment till the rising of the court and also to\n\npay a fine of Rs.2,00,000/- and in default of payment of fine, to\n\nundergo simple imprisonment for a period of two months. The trial\n\ncourt also directed that, if the fine amount was realised, it shall be\n\ngiven as compensation to the complainant.\n\n        3.      The petitioner filed Crl.A No. 102/2016 before the Court of\n\nSession, Thalassery challenging the order of conviction and sentence\n\npassed against him by the trial court. The appellate court confirmed\n\nthe conviction as well as the sentence against the petitioner and\n\ndismissed the appeal.Crl.Rev.Pet.No.226 OF 2020\n                                                      3\n\n        4.      Aggrieved by the concurrent findings of guilty, conviction\n\nand sentence made against him by the courts below, the accused has\n\nfiled this revision petition.\n\n        5.      Heard the learned counsel for the revision petitioner and\n\nalso the the second respondent/complainant.\n\n        6.       The case of the complainant is as follows: The complainant\n\nwas the driver of the accused. While so, the accused got into financial\n\ncrisis and he sought the help of the complainant. On request by the\n\naccused, the complainant pledged the gold ornaments of his wife and\n\ngave a total amount of Rs.2,02,290/- to the accused in instalments.\n\nOn 15.10.2013, when the complainant paid the last instalment of\n\nRs.78,000/-, the accused issued a cheque dated 21.11.2013 for\n\nRs.2,00,000/- to the complainant in discharge of the liability. When\n\nthe complainant presented the cheque in the bank, it was returned\n\nunpaid for the reason that there was no sufficient amount in the\n\naccount of the accused. The complainant sent a lawyer notice to the\n\naccused demanding payment of the amount of the cheque. The notice\n\nwas returned to the complainant as unclaimed. The accused did not\n\npay the amount of the cheque.Crl.Rev.Pet.No.226 OF 2020\n                                                      4\n        7.      During the trial of the case, the complainant got himself\n\nexamined as PW1 and four other witnesses were examined on his side\n\nas PW2 to PW5. Exts.P1 to P9 documents were marked on his side.\n\nNo evidence was adduced by the accused.\n\n        8.      When examined as PW1, the complainant gave evidence\n\nregarding the amounts borrowed by the accused from him. He also\n\ngave evidence regarding the issuing of Ext.P1 cheque by the accused\n\nin discharge of the liability. He stated that the accused had brought\n\nthe cheque filled up and that the accused signed the cheque in his\n\npresence and he gave it to him.\n\n        9.         The evidence of PW1 proves the execution of Ext.P1\n\ncheque by the accused and delivery of it by him to the complainant.\n\nThe accused also does not deny or dispute the signature in Ext.P1\n\ncheque.\n\n        10.      Once the execution of the cheque by the accused is proved\n\nby the complainant, the presumption under Section 139 of the Act\n\ncomes into play. The burden is upon the accused to rebut the\n\npresumption.\n\n        11.         The plea raised by the accused is as follows: The\n\ncomplainant, who was his driver, had arranged sale of the car\n\nbelonging to him to one Sandeep. There was a sale agreementCrl.Rev.Pet.No.226 OF 2020\n                                                      5\nbetween the accused and Sandeep. On the date of the agreement,\n\nSandeep paid Rs.50,000/- to the complainant as advance in order to\n\ngive that amount to the accused. However, the complainant did not\n\npay the amount to the accused. On 09.11.2013, the complainant came\n\nto the house of the accused for settling the matter. At that time, he\n\ncommitted theft of the signed blank cheque which was kept by the\n\naccused in a cover and he misused the aforesaid cheque and filed the\n\ncase.\n\n        12.      No evidence was adduced by the accused to prove the\n\naforesaid plea. Nothing was also brought out in the cross-examination\n\nof PW1 to prove that the aforesaid plea is probable.\n\n        13.      The accused had raised a plea that he had filed a complaint\n\nbefore the police against the complainant with regard to committing\n\ntheft of the cheque. The accused had also got a plea that he had\n\ninstituted a suit against the complainant in the Munsiff's Court,\n\nThalassery for return of the cheque. No documents were tendered in\n\nevidence by the accused to prove the aforesaid pleas.\n\n        14.  Even if it is accepted that the accused had filed a complaint\n\nbefore the police alleging that the complainant committed theft of the\n\ncheque, the fact that it was filed only after the dishonour of the\n\ncheque would indicate the falsity of the plea raised by the accused. HisCrl.Rev.Pet.No.226 OF 2020\n                                                      6\nplea that he came to know about the loss of the cheque only after the\n\ndishonour of the cheque cannot be believed. The accused has got a\n\nspecific case that he had kept the signed blank cheque in a cover and\n\nthat the complainant committed theft of the  cheque on 09.11.2013,\n\nwhen he came to his house. The cheque was presented in the bank on\n\n25.11.2013.  It cannot be believed that the accused was not aware of\n\nthe loss of the cheque for so many days. At any rate, there is no\n\nevidence adduced by the accused to prove the aforesaid plea.\n\n        15.     Moreover, there is no plausible and convincing explanation\n\ngiven by the accused as to why he had kept a signed blank cheque in\n\nhis house.\n\n        16.     The complainant has got a specific case that he had\n\npledged the gold ornaments of his wife and raised the amount for\n\nlending it to the accused. The complainant examined his wife as PW2\n\nto prove the pledging of gold ornaments. The complainant also\n\nexamined PW3 to PW5, the Managers of the co-operative banks to\n\nprove that he had pledged gold ornaments in the banks on particular\n\ndates and availed loan. Therefore, there is overwhelming evidence to\n\nprove the case of the complainant. There is no contra evidence. The\n\npresumption under Section 139 of the Act is also not rebutted by the\n\naccused.Crl.Rev.Pet.No.226 OF 2020\n                                                                     7\n          17.        In      the        aforesaid             circumstances,                   I     find        no       illegality,\n\nimpropriety or perversity in the appreciation of evidence and the\n\nfindings entered against the accused by the courts below.\n\n          18.        The courts below have appreciated the evidence and made\n\nconcurrent findings.  Ordinarily, in revisional jurisdiction, it would not\n\nbe appropriate for this Court to reappreciate the evidence and come to\n\nits own conclusion, when the evidence has already been appreciated\n\nby the Magistrate as well as the Sessions Judge in appeal, unless any\n\nglaring feature is brought to the notice of this Court which would\n\notherwise tantamount to gross miscarriage of justice. The revisional\n\ncourt is not meant to act as an appellate court.  Unless the finding of\n\nthe court, whose decision is sought to be revised, is shown to be\n\nperverse or untenable in law or is grossly erroneous or glaringly\n\nunreasonable or where the decision is based on no material or where\n\nthe material facts are wholly ignored or where the judicial discretion is\n\nexercised arbitrarily or capriciously, the High Court shall not interfere\n\nwith such finding or decision in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction\n\n(See        Kishan Rao v. Shankargouda : AIR 2018 SC 3173).\n\nConviction of the petitioner/accused for the offence under Section 138\n\nof the Act is only to be confirmed.Crl.Rev.Pet.No.226 OF 2020\n                                                      8\n        19.     The trial court has shown maximum leniency to the\n\npetitioner/accused in awarding the sentence.  The sentence imposed\n\non the petitioner/accused also does not call for any interference by\n\nthis Court.\n\n        20. Consequently, the revision petition is dismissed.  The order of\n\nconviction and sentence passed against the petitioner/accused by the\n\ntrial court, which stands affirmed by the appellate court, is confirmed.\n\nHowever, the petitioner/accused is granted a period of four months\n\nfrom today to remit  the  fine amount in the trial court.\n\n\n                                                  Sd/-R.

The trial court found the petitioner guilty of the offence\n\npunishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\n(hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') and convicted him thereunder.\n\nThe trial court sentenced him to imprisonment till the rising of the\n\ncourt and also directed him to pay an amount of Rs. 3,50,000/- as\n\ncompensation to the complainant and directed that, in default of\n\npayment of compensation, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for a\n\nperiod of six months.\n\n        3.      The petitioner filed Crl.A.No. 135/2017 before the Court of\n\nSession, Kottayam challenging the order of conviction and sentence\n\npassed against him by the trial court.  The appellate court confirmed\n\nthe conviction as well as the sentence against the petitioner andCrl.Rev.Pet.No.79 OF 2020\n                                                      3\ndismissed the appeal.\n\n        4.      Aggrieved by the concurrent findings of guilty, conviction\n\nand sentence made against him by the courts below, the accused in\n\nthe case has filed this revision petition.\n\n        5.      Heard the learned counsel for the revision petitioner.\n\n        6.      The case of the complainant is as follows: The accused had\n\nborrowed Rs.3,50,000/- from the complainant on 05.12.2014. In\n\ndischarge of that liability, the accused issued a cheque for that amount\n\non the very same day. The complainant presented the cheque in the\n\nbank. It was dishonoured for the reason that there was no sufficient\n\namount in the account of the accused.  The complainant sent a notice\n\nto the accused demanding payment of the amount of the cheque.\n\nInspite of the receipt of intimation from the postal authority, the\n\naccused did not claim the notice and it was returned to the\n\ncomplainant as unserved.  The accused did not pay the amount of the\n\ncheque.\n\n        7.      During the trial of the case, the complainant got himself\n\nexamined as PW1 and a witness was examined on his side as PW2.\n\nExts. P1 to P6 documents were also marked on the side of the\n\ncomplainant.  No evidence was adduced by the accused.\n\n        8.      When examined as PW1, the complainant gave evidenceCrl.Rev.Pet.No.79 OF 2020\n                                                      4\nregarding the borrowal of the amount from him by the accused and\n\nalso execution of Ext.P1 cheque by the accused and delivery of the\n\nsame to him in discharge of the liability.\n\n        9.      The plea of the accused was that he had borrowed only an\n\namount of Rs.1,40,000/- from the complainant and that he had given\n\nthe cheque to the complainant only as a security and that the\n\ncomplainant misused the cheque and filed the case.\n\n        10.     No evidence was adduced by the accused to prove the\n\naforesaid plea.  Nothing was also brought out in the cross-examination\n\nof PW1 to prove that the aforesaid plea is probable.\n\n        11.     The evidence of PW1 proves execution of Ext.P1 cheque by\n\nthe accused. Once execution of the cheque by the accused is proved,\n\nthe presumption under Section 139 of the Act comes into play.  The\n\nburden is upon the accused to rebut the presumption. The accused\n\nfailed to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the Act in any\n\nmanner.\n\n        12.     The courts below have properly analysed the evidence in\n\nthe case and come to the right conclusion.                                   I find no illegality,\n\nimpropriety or perversity in the appreciation of evidence by the courts\n\nbelow. Conviction of the petitioner for the offence punishable under\n\nSection 138 of the Act is only to be confirmed.Crl.Rev.Pet.No.79 OF 2020\n                                                                    5\n\n          13.        In the matter of sentence, the trial court as well as the\n\nappellate court has shown maximum leniency to the accused.  The\n\nsentence imposed on the accused also does not warrant interference\n\nby this Court except the default sentence imposed on him.\n\n          14.        In the result, the revision petition is dismissed. Conviction\n\nof the petitioner by the trial court for the offence under Section 138 of\n\nthe Act, which stands affirmed by the appellate court, is confirmed.\n\nThe sentence of imprisonment till the rising of the court imposed on\n\nthe petitioner/accused and the direction made to him by the courts\n\nbelow to pay an amount of Rs.3,50,000/- to the complainant as\n\ncompensation                   are        also        confirmed.               In       default           of      payment               of\n\ncompensation                   to      the        complainant,                 the        petitioner/accused                       shall\n\nundergo simple imprisonment for a period of two months.                                                                            The\n\npetitioner/accused is granted a period of six months from today to pay\n\nthe amount of compensation to the complainant.\n\n\n                                                               Sd/-R.

This is a complainant's appeal and is directed against the judgment\ndated  31.5.08 of the Learned Additional  Sessions Judge, Margao, by which\nthe accused has been acquitted under section 138 of the Negotiable\nInstruments Act, 1881.\n\n2.          The case of the complainant, in brief, is that  the accused had\nborrowed a sum of Rs.55,500/- from the complainant and had issued to the\ncomplainant five cheques,  the details of which are as follows:-\n            Sr.No.      Cheque No.      Date            Amount\n                   1.    0330062           16.5.2005       Rs. 45,000/-\n                   2.    0330070           16.5.2005       Rs.      500/-\n               3.          0330071         16.5.2005       Rs.   5,000/-\n                   4.          0330074        16.5.2005       Rs.   3,000/-\n                   5.    0330079           12.5.2005       Rs.   2,000/-\n                                                         Total       Rs. 55,500/-\n\n3.          As per the complainant the said cheques were deposited by the                                                               3\n\ncomplainant on 8.7.05 only to be returned dishonoured with a remark that\nthe funds were insufficient. The complainant, therefore, issued a notice to\nthe accused dated 14.7.05 and as the accused did not comply with the same,\nthe complaint was filed.   The complainant examined himself in support of\nhis complaint.\n\n4.          On the other hand, it was the case of the accused that the first\ncheque of Rs.45,000/- was given to the complainant as security  on the\ncondition that the same  was to be deposited after a period of one year from\nthe date  the complainant had given a loan amount to him.   It was further his\ncase that  the  cheque of Rs.5,000/- was given to the complainant as the\ncomplainant needed  the said amount to  pay the Bank Manager so that the\nloan could be obtained.              The cheque for Rs.500/- was given to the\ncomplainant  for some miscellaneous  work and the cheque for Rs.3,000/-\nwas given to the complainant as he demanded the same for his services for\nobtaining the loan           and the cheque for Rs.2,000/- was given to the\ncomplainant to meet further expenses.   The accused examined himself in\nsupport of his case.                                                               4\n\n5.          Admittedly, the cheques given by the accused were undated.  The\ncomplainant and the accused  were both Bank employees. The complainant\nhad retired  under a voluntary retirement scheme but was doing business of\nin cosmetics.  The accused was  running a prawn hatchery and in fact it was\nthe case of the accused  that  the  first cheque was given by him to the\ncomplainant undated in order to enable the complainant  to obtain a loan for\nhim and it appears from his evidence that  he had already taken a loan  of\nRs.75,000/- from the bank he was working and as such was unable to  obtain\nanother loan from his Bank.\n\n6.          The Learned J.M.F.C initially convicted the accused by Judgment\ndated 18.4.2007 holding that  as the accused had issued the subject cheques\nto the complainant and there was no dispute as regards the issuance of\ncheques, the signature, the amount and the name of the complainant, the\nburden was entirely on the accused to establish that the complainant had no\nauthority to put the date and encash the cheques.  The Learned trial Court\nfurther held that the complainant as payee had implied authority to put the\ndate and after he had put the date the presumption under section 118 (b)\noperated and the burden therefore  had shifted on the accused  to establish                                                               5\n\nthat he had not authorized the  complainant-drawee to put the date on the\ncheque.  The Learned trial Court  also held that the accused had failed to\nprove   by leading cogent evidence that there was no debt or other liability\nwhich according to the Learned trial Court had to be proved by bringing a\nwitness to corroborate the evidence led by the accused and as such the\naccused had not  discharged the burden cast on him.\n\n7.          The Learned First Appellate Court   observed, that from the cross\nexamination of the complainant it appeared that the complainant had paid\nRs.45,000/- at one time  and after a gap of  one and a half month  had paid\nRs.10,500/-  and if that was so it was not explained by the complainant or by\nhis  Advocate  and it was also not understood, as to why the complainant had\nreceived five different cheques out of which four were dated 16.5.2005 and\nthe remaining one was dated 12.5.05.  The Learned  First Appellate Court\nfurther observed that it was possible for the complainant to get only two\ncheques for the said two amounts, respectively.  The Learned First Appellate\nCourt further observed that the crossexamination of the complainant further\nshowed that the complainant had advanced money to the accused  in the\nmonth of November, 2002 and the accused had assured to make repayment                                                               6\n\nwithin one year and the cheques in question were dated 16.5.05 and 12.5.05\nand if at all  the accused had agreed to make repayment within one year it\nwas not explained by the complainant as to how the subject cheques were\ndated 16.5.05 and 12.5.05.  The Learned First Appellate Court also held that\nthe complainant had admitted that the dates appearing on the cheques in\nquestion were written by him which according to the Learned First Appellate\nCourt were written without the knowledge or consent of the accused for\nwhich the accused could not be held  responsible which aspect was not at all\ntaken into consideration by the Learned trial Court.  The Learned First\nAppellate  Court also held that the entire transaction as set out by the\ncomplainant appears to be highly fictitious  and the case of the complainant\nthat the complainant had advanced Rs.55,500/- to the accused and the\ncheques in question were issued by the accused for  the discharge of the debt\nor liability does not appear to be probable, convincing and trustworthy and\ntherefore the Learned First Appellate  Court proceeded to acquit the accused,\nas aforesaid.\n\n8.          Shri Lotlikar, the Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of\nthe complainant, submits that the approach of the Learned First Appellate                                                               7\n\nCourt is  erroneous.  Learned Senior  Counsel further submits that the\ncheques in question having been given by the accused without writing the\ndate, the complainant was entitled to  put the date and complete the same\nand send them for payment.  Shri Lotlikar submtis that these aspects were\nconsidered by the Learned trial Court.  Learned Counsel further submits that\nthe defence taken by the accused was not substantiated in as  much as the\naccused had also not disclosed as to the amount of  the loan which the\ncomplainant was to take on behalf of the accused and pay the amount of the\nloan to him.\n\n9.          On the other hand Shri S. S. Kakodkar the Learned Counsel on\nbehalf of the accused,  submits that the complainant came up with a case that\nthe entire loan of Rs.55,500/- was given to the accused at one stretch but in\ncross examination it was brought out that according  to  the  complainant\nRs.45,000/- were given in November, 2002 and the  balance   amount  of\nRs.10,500/-  was given  one and a half month later.   Learned Counsel\nfurther submits that  in case the complainant  had withdrawn the  sum  of\nRs.55,500/-, from the Bank before it was given to the accused nothing\nprevented the complainant from  producing the statement of account to                                                               8\n\nprove the said fact.  Learned Counsel futher submits that the complainant as\na Bank  employee  ought  to  have  known  that  any  payment  of  above\nRs.20,000/- had to be made by cheque as required by section 269 SS of the\nIncome Tax Act, 1961  and therefore the version of the complainant that he\nhad withdrawn the amount allegedly given to the accused from the Bank and\npaid to the accused cannot be accepted.  Learned Counsel further submits\nthat  in case the complainant had lent Rs.55,500/-  in two  installments  of\nRs.45,000/- and Rs.10,500/- the complainant has not explaind as to why\nthere was a need for the accused to have given five cheques and giving of\nfive cheques by the accused is in consonance with the case set out by the\naccused and regarding which the accused also gave his evidence.  Learned\nCounsel submits that  the facts stated by the complainant  are not free from\nsuspicion and therefore could not be accepted.  Learned Counsel has placed\nreliance on the case of  M.S. Narayana Menon alias Mani V/s. State of\nKerala and another {(2006) 6 SCC 39} and  Krishna Janardhan Bhat\nV/s. Dattatraya G. Hegde (AIR 2008 SC 1325).   In reply it has been\nsubmitted by Shri Lotlikar that it is the accused who gave five cheques and it\nis he  who ought to know as to why he gave five and not two or one in\nfavour of the complainant.                                                               9\n\n10.         As already stated, the complainant and the accused  were both\nBank employees and  were known to one another for twenty-five years as\nstated by the complainant.  The complainant has taken voluntary retirement\nwhile the accused continued with his Bank employment.  If the complainant\nhas given evidence in support of his case so has the accused and the accused\nhas consistently deposed in support of the defence taken by him that the\ncheques in question were given by the accused to the complainant as stated\nby him.  The accused was cross examined on behalf of the complainant and\nthe said cross examination  tends to support the case off the accused rather\nthan that of the complainant.   In the cross examination of the accused it was\nbrought on record by the complainant  that he had already taken the loan\nfrom the Bank where he was working, about four years back. It was also\nbrought out from his evidence that he was doing another business of prawn\nhatching and whether he had any license for the same or not was certainly\nnot relevant.  It was clearly suggested by the accused to the complainant that\nthe loan which the complainant was to take was meant for the prawn\nhatchery business of the accused.  Firstly, it must be noted  that the\ncomplainant did not adhere to his case set out in the complaint namely that                                                               10\n\nthe loan was given at a stretch and on the contrary admitted that it was given\non two occasions,  i.e.  first a sum of  Rs.45,000/- in November, 2002 and\nthereafter one and a half month later.   Secondly, according to the\ncomplainant the accused had agreed to pay the same within one year,\nhowever, the complainant is silent even on the aspect  as to when the\ncheques in question were given to him.   In his crosss-examination, it was\nstated by the complainant that he had assured  the accused to assist him  to\nobtain a loan  from the Bank in order to repay  his loan.  Different\ninterpretations are sought to be given on behalf of the complainant and on\nbehalf of the accused, to the said statement.  Learned Senior Counsel on\nbehalf of the complainant has submitted that said statement has been\nwrongly recorded since otherwise it was never the case of the complainant\nthat he had agreed to obtain a loan to give money to the accused to  run his\nbusiness.  On behalf of the accused, it is submitted that the words \"my loan\"\nhave mistakenly been recorded, but otherwise, the statement is correctly\nrecorded.   Be that as it may, the fact remains that the defence of the accused\nis consistent and in support of it the accused has given evidence and the\ncomplainant has not been able to  make any in road by cross examination in\nthe said evidence of the accused.  On the contrary  the complainant himself                                                               11\n\nhas not adhered to the case set up hy him in the complaint and on the\ncontrary has diverted from the case set out.  The accused, therefore,  by his\nown evidence had discharged the initial burden which was on him to show\nthat  the existence of consideration was improbable or doubtful.  Therefore,\nit  was for the complainant to have proved consideration as a matter of fact\nwhich the complainant has failed to do.\n\n11.         The view held by  the Learned First Appellate Court is a plausible\nview and this being an appeal against acquittal,  no interference  is called\nfor.  The appeal, therefore, is hereby dismissed.\n\n                                                                N. A. BRITTO, J\noc.\n\n"

The          aforesaid               case          is      one         instituted               upon           the\n\ncomplaint filed against the petitioner by the second respondent\n\nfor an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable\n\nInstruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').\n\n           3.         Annexure-A1 is the copy of the complaint.                                                                   The\n\nmaterial averments in Annexure-A1 complaint are as follows:\n\nThe complainant and his wife Hemalatha, Gafoor and the accused\n\nwere partners of the firm by name \u201cNora Foods\u201d.  They had\n\nexecuted a partnership deed on 17.02.2015.  The complainant\n\nand his wife retired from the partnership on 16.06.2016.  At theCrl.M.C.No.5339/2018                                                 3\n\ntime         of       retirement                 of       the        complainant                   and          his       wife,          a\n\nmemorandum of understanding was executed on 15.06.2016 by\n\nthem and Gafoor and the accused.  As per the memorandum of\n\nunderstanding and the deed of retirement, the accused and\n\nGafoor had agreed to settle the account of the complainant and\n\nhis wife.                The accused signed and issued a cheque dated\n\n31.12.2016 for Rs.18,00,000/- to the complainant in discharge of\n\nthat liability.  The complainant presented the cheque in the bank.\n\nIt was returned unpaid on 10.01.2017 for the reason that there\n\nwas no sufficient amount in the account of the accused.  The\n\ncomplainant sent a lawyer notice to the accused on 31.01.2017\n\ndemanding payment of the amount of the cheque.  The accused\n\nreceived the notice on 06.02.2017.  She sent a reply raising false\n\ncontentions.  She did not pay the amount of the cheque.  After\n\nreceiving the notice, on 04.03.2017, she paid an amount of\n\nRs.30,000/- to the complainant through bank transfer.\n\n           4.         This petition is filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C by the\n\naccused for quashing the proceedings against her in the case\n\nC.C.No.423/2017 which is based on Annexure-A1 complaint.Crl.M.C.No.5339/2018                                                 4\n\n           5.         Heard learned senior counsel who appeared for the\n\npetitioner                 and             also            the           counsel                 for          the            second\n\nrespondent/complainant.\n\n           6.         Learned senior counsel for the petitioner raised three\n\ngrounds before this Court for quashing Annexure-A1 complaint.\n\nThey are:                    (1) The averments contained in Annexure-A1\n\ncomplaint do not attract or disclose an offence punishable under\n\nSection 138 of the Act.  (2)  The cheque was issued by the\n\npetitioner/accused to the complainant not in discharge of any\n\nlegally enforceable debt or liability but only as a security.  (3)\n\nLearned Magistrate has mechanically taken cognizance of the\n\noffence without recording any reasons.\n\n           7.         There is no merit in the contention of the learned\n\nsenior counsel for the petitioner that Annexure-A1 complaint\n\ndoes not disclose the ingredients of an offence punishable under\n\nSection 138 of the Act. In Harihara Krishnan v. Thomas : AIR\n\n2017 SC 4125, the Supreme Court has stated as follows:\n\n                            \u201cObviously such complaints must contain the\n                       factual           allegations               constituting               each          of       the\n                       ingredients of the offence under Section 138.Crl.M.C.No.5339/2018                            5\n\n                Those ingredients are: (1) that a person drew a\n                cheque on an account maintained by him with the\n                banker; (2) that such a cheque when presented to\n                the bank is returned by the bank unpaid; (3) that\n                such a cheque was presented to the bank within a\n                period of six months from the date it was drawn or\n                within the period of its validity whichever is\n                earlier; (4) that the payee demanded in writing\n                from the drawer of the cheque the payment of the\n                amount of money due under the cheque to payee;\n                and (5) such a notice of payment is made within a\n                period of 30 days from the date of the receipt of\n                the information by the payee from the bank\n                regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid. It is\n                obvious from the scheme of Section 138 that each\n                one of the ingredients flows from a document\n                which      evidences        the     existence       of    such     an\n                ingredient. The only other ingredient which is\n                required to be proved to establish the commission\n                of an offence under Section 138 is that inspite of\n                the demand notice referred to above, the drawer\n                of the cheque failed to make the payment within a\n                period of 15 days from the date of the receipt of\n                the demand\u201d.\n        8.      Annexure-A1 complaint contains all the aforesaid\n\nfactual allegations disclosing and attracting an offence punishableCrl.M.C.No.5339/2018                                                 6\n\nunder Section 138 of the Act.\n\n           9.         Learned senior counsel for the petitioner invited the\n\nattention of this Court to Clause (4) in the memorandum of\n\nunderstanding (Annexure-A7) dated 15.06.2016 executed by the\n\nparties and contended that the cheque was issued by the\n\npetitioner to the complainant not in discharge of any liability or\n\ndebt but only as a security for the amount to be paid by the\n\nreconstituted firm.\n\n           10.        Clause               (4)         of         Annexure-A7                       memorandum                         of\n\nunderstanding reads as follows:\n\n                                  \u201cWhereas it is agreed by the 2nd party that\n                      the         amount               of        20,00,000/-                  availed             from\n                      Mr.Preman and Mr.Farooq are to be paid on or\n                      before July 20th, 2016 and Rs.18,00,000/- (Rupees\n                      Eighteen lakhs only) to the 1st party is to be paid\n                      on or before 31.12.2016.  For this the 2nd party\n                      has         given          personal             signed            cheque            for       the\n                      mentioned amount and date.  (Cheque No.71606\n                      SBT Mannur Branch).  The same cheque will be\n                      replaced               with          company                cheque              after          the\n                      reconstitution of the firm for the same amount and\n                      date.\u201dCrl.M.C.No.5339/2018                                                 7\n\n           11.        On a bare perusal of the stipulation contained in\n\nClause (4) of Annexure-A7 memorandum of understanding it can\n\nbe seen that the second party (the accused and Gafoor) had\n\nagreed to pay Rs.18,00,000/- to the first party (the complainant\n\nand his wife) and that the petitioner/accused had signed and\n\nissued her own cheque for an amount of Rs.18,00,000/- to the\n\ncomplainant for the aforesaid amount.\n\n           12.        Learned               senior           counsel             for       the        petitioner               would\n\ncontend that there is a specific stipulation in Clause (4) of\n\nAnnexure-A7 document that the cheque shall be replaced with\n\ncompany cheque after the reconstitution of the firm for the same\n\namount and date.  The accused has no case that the cheque\n\nissued to the complainant by her was replaced by the cheque of\n\nthe reconstituted firm.  If no such cheque was replaced, it eludes\n\ncomprehension how the complainant would be found fault with\n\nfor such omission.\n\n           13.        At any rate, when a cheque is admittedly signed and\n\nissued by a person to another person, the presumption under\n\nSection 139 of the Act arises that it was issued in discharge of aCrl.M.C.No.5339/2018                            8\n\nlegally enforceable debt or liability.  The burden is upon the\n\naccused to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the Act.\n\nThe presumption has to be rebutted by the accused during the\n\ntrial of the case.  It is for the accused to prove that there was no\n\nlegally enforceable debt or liability. It is a matter of proof and\n\nevidence.  It is not a matter which can be decided in a petition\n\nfiled under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\n\n        14.     Whether the cheque was given as security or not, or\n\nwhether there was outstanding liability or not,  is a question of\n\nfact which could be determined only by the trial court after\n\nrecording evidence of the parties. The High Court shall not\n\nexpress its view on disputed questions of fact in a petition under\n\nSection 482 Cr.P.C to come to a conclusion that the offence is not\n\nmade out (See HMT Watches Limited v. Abida : (2015) 11\n\nSCC 776).\n\n        15.     The other contention raised by the learned senior\n\ncounsel for the petitioner is that the learned Magistrate has\n\nmechanically taken cognizance of the offence and issued process\n\nwithout recording any reasons. I have already found thatCrl.M.C.No.5339/2018                            9\n\nAnnexure-A1 complaint contains necessary ingredients of an\n\noffence punishable under Section  138 of the Act.  Therefore, the\n\ncognizance of the offence taken by the learned Magistrate on the\n\nbasis of the averments in the complaint cannot be found fault\n\nwith.  The Magistrate is not expected to record reasons in detail\n\nat the time of taking cognizance.  What is necessary is only that\n\nthe learned Magistrate shall apply his mind to the averments in\n\nthe complaint.  In the instant case, there is nothing to show that\n\nthe learned Magistrate had not applied his mind to the averments\n\nin the complaint before taking cognizance of the offence and\n\nissuing process to the accused.\n\n        16. In determining the question whether any process is to\n\nbe issued or not, what the Magistrate has to be satisfied is\n\nwhether there is sufficient ground for proceeding and not\n\nwhether there is sufficient ground for conviction. Whether the\n\nevidence is adequate for supporting the conviction, can be\n\ndetermined only at the trial and not at the stage of inquiry. At the\n\nstage of issuing the process to the accused, the Magistrate is not\n\nrequired to record reasons. The legislature has stressed the needCrl.M.C.No.5339/2018                            10\n\nto record reasons in certain situations such as dismissal of a\n\ncomplaint without issuing process. There is no such legal\n\nrequirement imposed on a Magistrate for passing detailed order\n\nwhile issuing summons.

Act which were filed even prior to 2018\n\nAmendment Act i.e. 1st September, 2018.

Act, a minimum of 20% of the fine or\n\ncompensation awarded by the trial court is directed\n\n                                                                                                                        5/8                                                                                15.WP-4636 & 4637-2019.doc\n\nto be deposited and that such amount is to be\n\ndeposited within a period of 60 days from the date\n\nof the order, or within such further period not\n\nexeeding 30 days as may be directed by the appellate\n\ncourt for sufficient cause shown by the appellant.\n\nTherefore, if amended Section 148 of the N.I. Act is\n\npurposively interpreted in such a manner it would\n\nserve the Objects and Reasons of not only amendment\n\nin Section 148 of the N.I. Act, but also Section 138\n\nof the N.I. Act.  The Negotiable Instruments Act has\n\nbeen amended from time to time so as to provide,\n\ninter alia, speedy disposal of cases relating to the\n\noffence of the dishonour of cheques.  So as to see\n\nthat due to delay tactics by the unscrupulous\n\ndrawers of the dishonoured cheques due to easy\n\nfiling of the appeals and obtaining stay in the\n\nproceedings, an injustice was caused to the payee of\n\na dishonoured cheque who has to spend considerable\n\ntime and resources in the court proceedings to\n\nrelease the value of the cheque and having observed\n\n                                                                                                                        6/8                                                                                       15.WP-4636 & 4637-2019.doc\n\nthat such delay has compromised the sanctity of the\n\ncheque transactions, Parliament has thought it fit\n\nto amend Section 148 of the N.I. Act.  Therefore,\n\nsuch                  a            purposive                               interpretation                                           would                      be             in\n\nfurtherance of the Objections and Reasons of the\n\namendment in Section 148 of the N.I. Act and also\n\nSection 138 of the N.I. Act.\u201d\n\n                                                                                           (emphasis supplied)\n\n7.             The dictum is, amended Section 148 of the N.I.\n\nAct confers power upon the Appellate Court to direct\n\ndeposit the sum which shall not be less than 20 % of\n\nthe fine or compensation, either on application\n\nfiled by Original Complainant or even on application\n\nfiled by Appellant \u2013 Accused under Section 389 of\n\nCr.P.C.                         to             suspend                          the                sentence.                                       Therefore,\n\napplication                                    moved                     by             the                 Complainant                                    on             29th\n\nSeptember, 2019 under Section 148 claiming interim\n\ncompensation was perfectly maintainable.  Obviously,\n\nwhile granting bail to Appellants on 14th June, 2018,\n\n                                                                                                                        7/8                                                                                      15.WP-4636 & 4637-2019.doc\n\nComplainant  had  no  notice  or  knowledge  of  an\n\napplication moved by the Appellants \u2013 Accused.  In\n\nconsequence, I don\u2019t see any reason to interfere\n\nwith the order impugned, in supervisory jurisdiction\n\nof this Court.  Rule is discharged. Petitions are\n\ndismissed.  All interim orders stand vacated.\n\n                                                                                   (SANDEEP K.
